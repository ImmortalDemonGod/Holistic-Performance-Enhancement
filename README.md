# 🧙🏾‍♂️ Holistic Performance Enhancement (Cultivation)

Welcome to the **Holistic Performance Enhancement** project repository! This initiative aims to integrate multiple domains—**Running**, **Biology**, **Software Development**, and **Synergy**—to enhance overall performance through data-driven insights and a structured framework.

### 📄 Detailed Directory Descriptions

#### 1. `docs/` - Documentation
- **`1_background/`**  
  Contains high-level discussions, notes, background readings, and references. Convert initial conversations into structured Markdown files (e.g., `potential_overview.md`, `domains_background.md`).

- **`2_requirements/`**  
  Gathers functional and technical requirements for each domain, such as synergy measurement plans, data formats, and tooling constraints (e.g., Python libraries).

- **`3_design/`**  
  Stores architectural and process design documents detailing how running data, biology experiments, and coding metrics interconnect. Includes flowcharts, synergy measurement formulas, and UML diagrams.

- **`4_analysis/`**  
  Documents results from initial experiments or baseline studies. Each synergy test or domain-specific experiment has its own Markdown file with summaries, data references, and conclusions.

#### 2. `data/` - Data Management
- **Structure**: Organized by domain to separate raw and processed data.
  - **`running/`**: CSV/JSON files for run logs, pace data, heart rate metrics.
  - **`biology/`**: Research logs, quiz/test results, raw data sets from lab experiments.
  - **`software/`**: Code metrics like commit logs, bug counts, lint/test coverage outputs.
  - **`synergy/`**: Combined datasets merging variables from multiple domains (e.g., merged CSV with run data and commit frequency).

#### 3. `scripts/` - Automation Scripts
- **Purpose**: Contains Python or Bash scripts for data cleaning, analysis, and synergy calculations.
  - **`running/`**: Scripts to parse wearable device logs, calculate weekly aggregates, run regression models on pace vs. VO₂ data.
  - **`biology/`**: Scripts for summarizing paper readings, analyzing quiz performance, scraping research databases.
  - **`software/`**: Automation scripts for analyzing commit logs, testing coverage, generating summaries.
  - **`synergy/`**: Specialized scripts that cross-reference running performance with code quality improvements.

#### 4. `notebooks/` - Jupyter Notebooks
- **Purpose**: Interactive notebooks for exploratory data analysis, visualization, and synergy prototyping.
  - **`running/`**: Visualizing run pace improvements, discovering correlations.
  - **`biology/`**: Analyzing reading logs, quiz scores, research data sets.
  - **`software/`**: Exploring commit or code review metrics, identifying trends over time.
  - **`synergy/`**: Consolidating data from all domains to test synergy hypotheses (e.g., running’s impact on coding output).

#### 5. `ci_cd/` - Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment
- **Purpose**: Configuration files for CI/CD pipelines (e.g., GitHub Actions, Jenkins) that automate tests and data analyses on commits or schedules.
  - **Example**: GitHub Actions YAML file that triggers synergy scripts on new data pushes and updates a dashboard with results.

#### 6. `README.md` - Project Overview
- **Purpose**: Provides a high-level overview of the repository, setup instructions, contribution guidelines, and licensing information.

#### 7. `.gitignore` - Git Configuration
- **Purpose**: Specifies files and directories to ignore in Git (e.g., large data logs, secret tokens, environment files, script outputs).
