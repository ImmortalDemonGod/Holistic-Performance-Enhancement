# Task ID: 7
# Title: Document Loop Penalties and Electrostatic Effects in RNA
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 6
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create materials explaining loop penalties, electrostatic repulsion, and their effects on RNA stability.
# Details:
Document loop penalties as an entropic cost associated with the conformational restriction of forming hairpin loops, internal loops, bulges, and multi-loops. Explain how loop penalties depend on loop type and size. Document electrostatic repulsion from the negatively charged phosphate backbone and the mitigating role of counterions (e.g., Mg²⁺). Write a detailed explanation of why forming a hairpin loop is entropically unfavorable and what factors influence this unfavorable contribution. Create flashcards for loop penalties, electrostatic repulsion, and the role of counterions in RNA stability.

# Test Strategy:
Review the loop penalties and electrostatic effects documentation for accuracy. Verify that the explanation of entropic costs for loop formation is clear and correct. Ensure the role of counterions in mitigating electrostatic repulsion is properly explained.
