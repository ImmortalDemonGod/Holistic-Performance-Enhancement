# Task ID: 4
# Title: Develop RNA vs. DNA Comparison Materials
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3
# Priority: high

# Description:
Create detailed comparison materials highlighting the structural and functional differences between RNA and DNA.

# Details:
Write a comprehensive comparison between RNA and DNA covering: 1) Sugar differences (ribose vs. deoxyribose) with focus on the 2'-OH group's implications for structure, 2) Base differences (Uracil vs. Thymine), 3) Strandedness differences and their functional implications, and 4) Stability and reactivity differences. Create a 1-2 paragraph explanation detailing why the 2'-hydroxyl group on ribose is significant for RNA's structural properties, reactivity, and functional versatility compared to DNA. Optional: Research and sketch the preferred sugar pucker conformations for ribose (C3'-endo) in A-form RNA helices versus deoxyribose (C2'-endo) in B-form DNA.

# Test Strategy:
Review the RNA vs. DNA comparison for accuracy and comprehensiveness. Verify that the explanation of the 2'-OH significance addresses its role in RNA catalysis, forming A-form helices, and susceptibility to alkaline hydrolysis. Check that all key structural and functional differences are clearly articulated.
