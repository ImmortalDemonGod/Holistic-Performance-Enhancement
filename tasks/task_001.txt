# Task ID: 1
# Title: Set up RNA Biophysics Knowledge Base Structure
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high

# Description:
Create the initial knowledge base structure for organizing RNA biochemistry and thermodynamics concepts, including sections for notes, diagrams, and summaries.

# Details:
Create a dedicated section in your personal knowledge management system (e.g., Obsidian, Notion, or local Markdown files) titled 'Pillar 1 Foundations: RNA Biochemistry & Thermodynamics'. Set up subsections for: 1) RNA Nucleotide Structure, 2) Phosphodiester Backbone, 3) RNA vs DNA Comparison, 4) Thermodynamic Principles, 5) Energetic Contributions to RNA Stability, and 6) Environmental Factors. Include placeholder files for diagrams, explanations, and quiz materials.

# Test Strategy:
Verify the knowledge base structure is complete with all required sections and placeholder files. Ensure the organization follows a logical progression that supports the learning objectives.

# Subtask Details:

## Subtask 1.1: Create Main Knowledge Base Structure and Root Section
Description: Set up the main knowledge base folder/section and create the root 'Pillar 1 Foundations: RNA Biochemistry & Thermodynamics' section with an index or overview document
Subtask Details:
1. Choose and prepare your knowledge management system (Obsidian, Notion, or local Markdown files)
2. Create a main folder/section for the RNA Biophysics Knowledge Base
3. Create a root document titled 'Pillar 1 Foundations: RNA Biochemistry & Thermodynamics'
4. In the root document, write a brief overview describing the purpose and scope of this pillar
5. Create a table of contents that will link to each subsection
6. Add metadata tags for easy reference and searching (e.g., #RNA, #biophysics, #foundations)
7. Test by ensuring the root document is properly saved and accessible

## Subtask 1.2: Establish Six Core Subsections with Folder Structure
Description: Create the six required subsections as separate folders/sections with index documents for each topic area
Subtask Details:
1. Within the main Pillar 1 folder, create six separate folders/sections titled:
   - 1.1 RNA Nucleotide Structure
   - 1.2 Phosphodiester Backbone
   - 1.3 RNA vs DNA Comparison
   - 1.4 Thermodynamic Principles
   - 1.5 Energetic Contributions to RNA Stability
   - 1.6 Environmental Factors
2. For each subsection, create an index document that briefly describes the topic and its importance
3. Update the root document's table of contents with links to each subsection
4. Add consistent metadata tags to each subsection for organization
5. Test by navigating between the main index and each subsection to verify links work correctly

Risks: Not specified
Mitigation: Not specified

## Subtask 1.3: Create Content Template Files for Each Subsection
Description: Develop and implement standardized template files for notes, diagrams, and explanations within each subsection
Subtask Details:
1. Design a standardized template format for three types of content:
   - Notes template (with headers for key concepts, definitions, and references)
   - Diagram placeholder (with instructions for diagram types needed)
   - Explanation template (with sections for detailed explanations and examples)
2. For each of the six subsections, create these three template files
3. Name files consistently (e.g., '1.1-Notes.md', '1.1-Diagrams.md', '1.1-Explanations.md')
4. Add placeholder text in each file describing the expected content
5. Include metadata and tagging consistent with the knowledge base structure
6. Test by opening each file to verify template structure is consistent and properly formatted

Dependencies: 2
Status: done
Risks: Not specified
Mitigation: Not specified

## Subtask 1.4: Develop Quiz and Assessment Materials Structure
Description: Create a dedicated quiz/assessment section with templates for self-testing materials for each topic
Subtask Details:
1. Create a 'Quizzes and Assessments' folder within the Pillar 1 section
2. Design a standardized quiz template with sections for:
   - Multiple choice questions
   - Short answer questions
   - Diagram interpretation exercises
   - Problem-solving scenarios
3. Create six quiz template files, one for each subsection (e.g., 'Quiz-1.1-RNA-Nucleotide-Structure.md')
4. Add placeholder questions in each quiz file related to the corresponding topic
5. Create an index file for the quiz section explaining how to use the materials
6. Link the quiz section in the main Pillar 1 index document
7. Test by reviewing each quiz template for consistency and proper formatting

Dependencies: 2
Status: done
Risks: Not specified
Mitigation: Not specified

## Subtask 1.5: Implement Cross-References and Learning Progression Structure
Description: Organize sections in a logical learning sequence and add cross-references between related concepts across subsections
Subtask Details:
1. Review all created sections and reorder if necessary to ensure logical learning progression
2. Update the main index document to include a suggested learning path through the materials
3. Create a 'Cross-References' section in each subsection index document
4. Identify and document relationships between topics (e.g., how RNA structure affects thermodynamic properties)
5. Add bidirectional links between related concepts across different subsections
6. Create a visual concept map document showing relationships between all topics
7. Verify the entire knowledge base structure by:
   - Checking all links work correctly
   - Confirming all required sections and placeholders exist
   - Testing navigation through the suggested learning path
   - Ensuring consistent formatting and naming conventions throughout
