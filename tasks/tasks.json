Implement tagging and categorization features for flashcards\n3. Create an interface for adding, editing, and reviewing flashcards\n4. Develop a spaced repetition algorithm that schedules reviews based on difficulty ratings and review history\n5. Design integration points with the HPE Flash-Memory Layer\n6. Implement export/import functionality for flashcard decks\n7. Add analytics to track retention rates and identify difficult cards\n\nTesting approach:\n- Test the spaced repetition algorithm with sample flashcards\n- Verify proper scheduling of reviews\n- Test integration with HPE Flash-Memory Layer\n- Validate analytics calculations",
