# Task ID: 6
# Title: Document Base Stacking and Hydrogen Bonding in RNA
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create materials explaining base stacking and hydrogen bonding contributions to RNA stability.
# Details:
Document base stacking interactions, including their nature (van der Waals, hydrophobic, dipole-dipole/π-π electronic interactions), significance as a major stabilizing force, and sequence dependence. Explain hydrogen bonding in base pairs, including Watson-Crick A-U (2 H-bonds), G-C (3 H-bonds), and G-U wobble pairs (2 H-bonds, different geometry). Write a detailed explanation (2-3 paragraphs) contrasting the roles and relative energetic contributions of base stacking versus hydrogen bonding in stabilizing an RNA helix. Create a thought experiment comparing the stability of two hairpins: one with 5 G-C pairs versus one with 5 A-U pairs, justifying the prediction based on thermodynamic principles. Create flashcards for base stacking and hydrogen bonding concepts.

# Test Strategy:
Review the base stacking and hydrogen bonding documentation for accuracy. Verify that the explanation correctly identifies base stacking as the major contributor to helix stability while hydrogen bonding contributes more to specificity. Check that the thought experiment includes a well-reasoned prediction based on thermodynamic principles.
