# Task ID: 2
# Title: Develop RNA Nucleotide Structure Materials
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Create comprehensive materials on RNA nucleotide structure, including diagrams of nucleotide components and base structures.
# Details:
Draw and label a generic RNA nucleotide showing the phosphate group, ribose sugar (with numbered carbons 1'-5'), and placeholder for the base. Highlight the critical 2'-hydroxyl group. Create detailed chemical structures of the four standard RNA bases (Adenine, Guanine, Cytosine, Uracil) and identify them as purines or pyrimidines. Include notes on nucleosides vs. nucleotides and the chemical properties of each component. Create flashcards for key terms, chemical structures, and important distinctions.

# Test Strategy:
Review drawings for accuracy and completeness. Verify all components are correctly labeled and the 2'-OH group is explicitly highlighted. Confirm that the base structures are chemically accurate and properly classified as purines or pyrimidines.

### Dependencies: 2.1
### Description: Create chemically accurate diagrams of the four standard RNA bases (Adenine, Guanine, Cytosine, Uracil) with proper classification and labeling.

   - Uracil (U) - with proper pyrimidine ring structure
2. Label each structure with its full name and single-letter abbreviation
3. Group and label bases as purines (A, G) or pyrimidines (C, U)
4. For each base, indicate the attachment point to the ribose (N9 for purines, N1 for pyrimidines)
5. Include hydrogen bond donor and acceptor sites important for base pairing
6. Test by comparing to standard biochemistry references and having an expert verify accuracy

## 3. Write explanatory notes on nucleotide chemistry and properties [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.1, 2.2

### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Write clear explanations of:
   - The difference between nucleosides (base + sugar) and nucleotides (base + sugar + phosphate)
   - Chemical properties of the phosphate group (negative charge, role in backbone formation)
   - Properties of the ribose sugar (chirality, reactivity of the 2'-OH group)
   - Chemical characteristics of purine vs. pyrimidine bases
   - Hydrogen bonding capabilities of each base
2. Include information on the nomenclature system used for RNA nucleotides
3. Explain the significance of the 2'-hydroxyl group in RNA function and stability
4. Add notes on tautomeric forms of bases and their biological significance
5. Include a section on modified RNA bases found in nature
6. Test by having a biochemistry student review for clarity and accuracy

## 4. Create educational flashcards for RNA nucleotide structures [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3
### Description: Develop a comprehensive set of educational flashcards covering key terms, chemical structures, and important distinctions related to RNA nucleotides.
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Design a template for flashcards with clear front/back format
2. Create flashcards for the following categories:
   - Structure identification (image of structure on front, name and key features on back)
   - Key terms (term on front, definition on back)
   - Comparisons (e.g., 'Difference between nucleoside and nucleotide?' on front, explanation on back)
   - Base classification (base structure on front, classification and properties on back)
3. Include at least 20 flashcards covering all essential concepts
4. Ensure each flashcard has a clear learning objective
5. Format flashcards for both digital use and printing
6. Test by having students use the flashcards and provide feedback on clarity and usefulness

## 5. Review and finalize all RNA nucleotide structure materials [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4
### Description: Conduct a comprehensive review of all created materials for accuracy, clarity, consistency, and educational effectiveness.
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Systematically review all diagrams for:
   - Chemical accuracy (bond angles, atom positions, functional groups)
   - Clarity of labeling and annotations
   - Consistency across all materials
   - Visual quality and readability
2. Review all written explanations for:
   - Scientific accuracy
   - Clarity and appropriate level of detail
   - Logical flow of information
   - Absence of contradictions or ambiguities
3. Have at least one subject matter expert review all materials
4. Test materials with the target audience (e.g., students) and collect feedback
5. Make necessary revisions based on all feedback
6. Compile final materials into a cohesive package with table of contents and consistent formatting
7. Test final materials by having someone learn RNA nucleotide structure using only these materials
