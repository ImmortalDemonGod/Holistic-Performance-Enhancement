# Task ID: 14
# Title: Implement Standardized Project Task Runner (Taskfile)
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Evaluate, select, and implement a project-wide command-line task runner using Go Task with Taskfile.yml to standardize commands for all common development and operational tasks.
# Details:
Implement a standardized task runner using Go Task to provide consistent commands for development, operational, and utility tasks, enhancing developer experience and automation.

# Test Strategy:
Verify that all defined tasks in the Taskfile.yml execute correctly across platforms (Linux, macOS, Windows/WSL), that documentation is clear and validated by a peer, that error handling is robust, and that no significant performance overhead is introduced. A verification checklist must be completed before marking this task as done.

### Details:


## 10. Refactor one CI workflow to use Task Runner [done]
### Dependencies: 14.8
### Description: As a proof of concept, refactor one existing GitHub Actions workflow (e.g., `markdown-lint.yml`) to call a `task` command instead of the raw script call.
