# Task ID: 14
# Title: Implement Standardized Project Task Runner (Taskfile)
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high

# Description:
Evaluate, select, and implement a project-wide command-line task runner using Go Task with Taskfile.yml to standardize commands for all common development and operational tasks.

# Details:
Implement a standardized task runner using Go Task to provide consistent commands for development, operational, and utility tasks, enhancing developer experience and automation.

# Test Strategy:
Verify that all defined tasks in the Taskfile.yml execute correctly across platforms (Linux, macOS, Windows/WSL), that documentation is clear and validated by a peer, that error handling is robust, and that no significant performance overhead is introduced. A verification checklist must be completed before marking this task as done.

# HPE Learning Meta (Main Task):
    Task objective summary: To implement a project-wide command-line task runner (Go Task with Taskfile.yml) to provide standardized, discoverable, and easily memorable commands for all common development, build, test, and operational tasks.
    Estimated effort tshirt: M
    Estimated effort hours raw: 1-2 days
    Estimated effort hours min: 6
    Estimated effort hours max: 12
    Mastery criteria summary: A functional Taskfile.yml is committed to the project root, covering all key task categories. Developer documentation is updated with new setup and usage instructions. At least one CI workflow is refactored to use the task runner.
    Activity type: devops_tooling_implementation
    Recommended block: deep_work
    Deliverables: ['A well-documented Taskfile.yml at the project root.', 'Standardized commands for at least 7-10 key development lifecycle operations.', 'Updated developer setup documentation in README.md or DEVELOPMENT.md.', 'At least one CI workflow refactored to use the new task commands.']
# Subtask Details:

## Subtask 14.1: Install and configure Go Task
Description: Install Go Task locally and ensure it's available in the development environment. This may involve updating PATH or installing via a package manager.
Dependencies: None
Status: done
Risks: Not specified
Mitigation: Not specified

## Subtask 14.2: Create root Taskfile.yml with basic structure
Description: Initialize the `Taskfile.yml` at the project root with the version declaration and a `vars` section for common paths like the Python venv and cultivation root.
Dependencies: 1
Status: done
Risks: Not specified
Mitigation: Not specified

## Subtask 14.3: Implement 'Setup' tasks
Description: Create tasks for initial environment setup, including Python virtual environment creation and dependency installation (`task setup`).
Dependencies: 2
Status: done
Risks: Not specified
Mitigation: Not specified

## Subtask 14.4: Implement 'Development' tasks
Description: Create namespaced or grouped tasks for `lint` (Python, Markdown) and `test` (pytest suite).
Dependencies: 2
Status: done
Risks: Not specified
Mitigation: Not specified

## Subtask 14.5: Implement 'Documentation' tasks
Description: Create tasks for building (`task docs:build`), serving locally (`task docs:serve`), and deploying the MkDocs site (`task docs:deploy`).
Dependencies: 2
Status: done
Risks: Not specified
Mitigation: Not specified

## Subtask 14.6: Implement 'Operational' tasks for key pipelines
Description: Create wrapper tasks for running key project pipelines, such as `task run:dev-reflect`, `task run:sync-wellness`, and `task run:process-runs`.
Dependencies: 2
Status: done
Risks: Not specified
Mitigation: Not specified

## Subtask 14.7: Implement 'Utility' tasks
Description: Create utility tasks like `clean` to remove temporary files and caches.
Dependencies: 2
Status: done
Risks: Not specified
Mitigation: Not specified

## Subtask 14.8: Document all commands in Taskfile.yml
Description: Ensure every task and namespace in the Taskfile has a clear `desc:` field explaining its purpose and usage.
Dependencies: 3, 4, 5, 6, 7
Status: done
Risks: Not specified
Mitigation: Not specified

## Subtask 14.9: Update project README with Task Runner instructions
Description: Refactor the main `README.md` to guide developers to use the new task runner for setup and daily operations.
Dependencies: 8
Status: done
Risks: Not specified
Mitigation: Not specified

## Subtask 14.10: Refactor one CI workflow to use Task Runner
Description: As a proof of concept, refactor one existing GitHub Actions workflow (e.g., `markdown-lint.yml`) to call a `task` command instead of the raw script call.
Dependencies: 8
Status: done
Risks: Not specified
Mitigation: Not specified
