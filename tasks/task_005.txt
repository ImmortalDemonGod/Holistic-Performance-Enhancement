# Task ID: 5
# Title: Develop Thermodynamic Principles Materials
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create comprehensive materials explaining fundamental thermodynamic principles relevant to RNA folding.
# Details:
Document the concept of Gibbs Free Energy (ΔG) and its relationship to enthalpy (ΔH), entropy (ΔS), and temperature (T) in the context of molecular stability (ΔG = ΔH - TΔS). Explain why a negative ΔG is favorable for spontaneous processes like RNA folding into stable structures. Define chemical equilibrium and relate it to the concept of a Minimum Free Energy (MFE) structure for RNA. Write a 2-3 paragraph explanation of what Gibbs Free Energy represents and why structures with more negative ΔG are considered more stable for RNA molecules. Create flashcards for ΔG, ΔH, ΔS definitions and their relationship, MFE, and thermodynamic concepts related to spontaneity.

# Test Strategy:
Review the thermodynamic principles documentation for accuracy and clarity. Verify that the explanation of Gibbs Free Energy correctly relates to RNA stability. Ensure the relationship between ΔG, ΔH, and TΔS is properly explained in the context of RNA folding.
