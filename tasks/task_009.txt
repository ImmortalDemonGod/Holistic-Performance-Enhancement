# Task ID: 9
# Title: Develop Comprehensive Self-Assessment Materials
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 8
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create a comprehensive quiz and practical assessment tasks to evaluate mastery of RNA biochemistry and thermodynamics concepts.
# Details:
Create a comprehensive quiz of 15-20 questions covering all learning objectives, including multiple-choice, true/false, short answer, and fill-in-the-blank questions. Design a practical assessment task requiring drawing a detailed, labeled RNA nucleotide and writing a clear explanation of the key energetic contributions to RNA secondary structure stability. Create a grading rubric for both the quiz and practical assessment, with ≥85% accuracy as the target for demonstrating mastery. Include a template for identifying weak areas and planning targeted review.

# Test Strategy:
Review the self-assessment materials for comprehensive coverage of all learning objectives. Verify that the quiz includes a good mix of question types and difficulty levels. Ensure the practical assessment effectively tests the ability to apply knowledge of RNA structure and thermodynamics.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Develop a Comprehensive Quiz with Mixed Question Formats [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a 15-20 question quiz covering all RNA biochemistry and thermodynamics learning objectives with varied question formats and difficulty levels.
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Review all learning objectives to ensure comprehensive coverage
2. Create 5-7 multiple-choice questions with 4 answer options each
3. Develop 3-4 true/false questions with clear statements
4. Design 4-5 short answer questions requiring 2-3 sentence responses
5. Create 3-4 fill-in-the-blank questions focusing on key terms and concepts
6. Ensure questions span all difficulty levels (basic recall, application, analysis)
7. Include answer key with explanations for each question
8. Organize questions by topic area for easier assessment

Testing approach: Have subject matter experts review for accuracy, clarity, and alignment with learning objectives. Verify that questions accurately assess understanding rather than just memorization.

## 2. Design Practical Assessment Task for RNA Structure [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a practical assessment requiring students to draw a detailed RNA nucleotide and explain energetic contributions to RNA secondary structure stability.
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Develop clear instructions for the nucleotide drawing portion, specifying required labels (e.g., 5' and 3' ends, phosphate groups, ribose sugar, nitrogenous base, hydrogen bonds)
2. Create a template or workspace for the drawing portion
3. Draft specific prompts for the written explanation component, requiring students to address:
   - Base-pairing interactions and hydrogen bonding
   - Base-stacking interactions
   - Electrostatic interactions
   - Solvent effects
   - Entropic contributions
4. Specify expected length (e.g., 250-300 words) and format for the explanation
5. Create an exemplar answer for instructor reference

Testing approach: Create a sample response to ensure the task can be completed within reasonable time constraints. Verify that instructions are unambiguous and that the task effectively tests conceptual understanding.

## 3. Create Comprehensive Grading Rubrics [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1, 9.2
### Description: Develop detailed grading rubrics for both the quiz and practical assessment, defining mastery as ≥85% accuracy.
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. For the quiz:
   - Assign point values to each question type (e.g., 1 point for T/F, 2 points for multiple choice, 3-5 points for short answer)
   - Create a total point scale (e.g., out of 50 points)
   - Define mastery threshold at 85% (e.g., 43/50 points)
   - Develop partial credit guidelines for short answer questions

2. For the practical assessment:
   - Create a detailed rubric for the RNA nucleotide drawing (10-15 points) covering accuracy, completeness, and proper labeling
   - Develop a rubric for the written explanation (15-20 points) evaluating conceptual understanding, completeness, accuracy, and clarity
   - Define specific criteria for each score level
   - Set mastery threshold at 85% of total points

3. Include guidelines for consistent grading across multiple evaluators

Testing approach: Apply rubrics to sample student work to verify clarity and fairness. Ensure rubrics align with learning objectives and properly weight the most important concepts.

## 4. Develop Personalized Review Template [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1, 9.2, 9.3
### Description: Create a template to help students identify weak areas and plan targeted review based on assessment results.
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Design a self-reflection section prompting students to analyze their performance
2. Create a structured format for categorizing quiz and practical assessment results by topic area (e.g., RNA structure, thermodynamic principles, biochemical properties)
3. Develop a scoring matrix that maps questions to specific learning objectives
4. Create a template section for identifying knowledge gaps based on missed questions
5. Design a targeted study plan template with:
   - Space to list weak areas requiring review
   - Recommended resources for each topic area
   - Suggested practice exercises
   - Timeline for review completion
   - Self-check mechanisms to verify improvement
6. Include examples of completed templates as models

Testing approach: Have students test the template with sample assessment results to ensure it effectively guides them to identify knowledge gaps and create actionable review plans.

## 5. Review and Validate Assessment Materials [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1, 9.2, 9.3, 9.4
### Description: Conduct comprehensive review of all assessment materials for coverage, clarity, and alignment with learning objectives.
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Create a mapping document linking each assessment item to specific learning objectives
2. Verify all learning objectives are adequately covered across assessment materials
3. Review language for clarity, precision, and appropriate scientific terminology
4. Check for balanced coverage of topics based on their importance
5. Verify progressive difficulty levels throughout the assessment materials
6. Ensure practical assessment and quiz complement each other in coverage
7. Review rubrics for fair evaluation criteria
8. Validate that the review template effectively guides students to address knowledge gaps
9. Make final revisions based on review findings
10. Compile all materials into a cohesive assessment package with clear instructions

Testing approach: Conduct pilot testing with a small group of students and instructors to gather feedback on clarity, difficulty level, and effectiveness. Make final adjustments based on this feedback before full implementation.
