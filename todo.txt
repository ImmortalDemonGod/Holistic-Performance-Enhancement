(done J)fix training from checkpoint

re-implement current avg loss in training (this should reset every epoc)

fix the evaluate to utilize evaluation data in its proper form (only use eval_data_prep for data)
fix the evaluate to utilize training data in its proper form (only use data_preparation.py for data)
fix the evaluate to perform accuracy evaluation on Training validation data in its proper form (only use data_preparation.py for data)
add to the evaluate to perform accuracy evaluation on Training training data in its proper form (only use data_preparation.py for data)
verify the evaluate.py to perform accuracy evaluation on evaluation validation data only.
(each of the different kinds of evaluations you can do should have different mode options and not just always do all of them)
    (-you also could make each mode or type into its own file for a similar effect)

verify that the finetuner loads from checkpoint
fix the finetuning to utilize evaluation data in its proper form (only use eval_data_prep for data)
implement custom finetuning dropout values
