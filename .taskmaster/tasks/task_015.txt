# Task ID: 15
# Title: Mastery: RNA Monomer Biophysics
# Status: in-progress
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium

# Description:
Systematic learning of the RNA monomer document using the pre-testing workflow.

# Details:
This task involves a deep dive into the biophysical properties of RNA monomers. Key activities include:
1.  Thoroughly reading and understanding the designated RNA monomer document.
2.  Utilizing the pre-testing workflow to identify knowledge gaps.
3.  Creating flashcards, notes, or other learning aids for key concepts.
4.  Focusing on aspects like chemical structure, charge distribution, conformational flexibility, and interactions relevant to RNA folding and function.

# Test Strategy:
Mastery will be assessed through:
1.  Successful completion of a post-learning assessment (e.g., a quiz or self-test) with a target score (e.g., >90%).
2.  Ability to explain key concepts from the document without referring to notes.
3.  Demonstrating understanding by applying learned concepts to simple hypothetical scenarios or problem-solving exercises related to RNA monomer biophysics.
4.  Confirmation that all identified knowledge gaps from the pre-testing phase have been addressed.
