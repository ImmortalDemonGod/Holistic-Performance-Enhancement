# Task ID: 8
# Title: Document Environmental Influences on RNA Stability
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 7
# Priority: low

# Description:
Create materials explaining how environmental factors like temperature and salt concentration affect RNA folding and stability.

# Details:
Document how temperature affects RNA stability through its impact on the TΔS term in the Gibbs Free Energy equation, explaining that higher temperatures favor unfolding. Explain how salt concentration, particularly the presence of cations like Mg²⁺, shields phosphate charges and stabilizes helices and compact folds. Briefly mention how extreme pH can alter protonation states of bases and disrupt hydrogen bonding. Create a short summary of how these environmental factors might be relevant to RNA structure prediction tools. Create flashcards for the effects of temperature, salt concentration, and pH on RNA stability.

# Test Strategy:
Review the environmental influences documentation for accuracy and completeness. Verify that the explanation of temperature effects correctly relates to the TΔS term. Ensure the role of salt concentration in stabilizing RNA structures is properly explained.
