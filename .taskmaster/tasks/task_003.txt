# Task ID: 3
# Title: Document RNA Polymer Structure and Backbone
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: high

# Description:
Create materials explaining the phosphodiester backbone, RNA directionality, and polymer structure.

# Details:
Draw a short RNA dinucleotide (e.g., A-U) showing and labeling the 5'-3' phosphodiester bond, the 5' end, and the 3' end. Document the formation of the phosphodiester backbone, including the directionality of an RNA strand and its implications. Include notes on the overall charge and properties of the backbone. Create a concise explanation of why RNA's 5'-to-3' directionality matters functionally and structurally. Develop flashcards for phosphodiester bond characteristics and RNA directionality concepts.

# Test Strategy:
Verify the dinucleotide drawing shows correct linkage between nucleotides with properly labeled 5' and 3' ends. Check that the explanation of directionality is clear and accurate. Ensure flashcards effectively capture key concepts about the phosphodiester backbone.
