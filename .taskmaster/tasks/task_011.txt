# Subtask Details:

## Subtask 11.1: Complete and Score Self-Created Week 1 RNA Quiz
Description: Take the previously created Week 1 RNA foundations quiz (from Task 9.1), record your answers, and calculate your initial score.
Subtask Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Retrieve the quiz created in Task 9.1
2. Set aside 30-45 minutes of uninterrupted time to complete the quiz
3. Answer all questions without referring to notes or external resources
4. Record your answers in a document
5. Calculate your raw score based on the answer key
6. Document any questions you found particularly challenging
7. Save your completed quiz with answers and initial score for later review

Testing approach: Verify all questions have been answered and initial scoring is complete before proceeding to the next subtask.

## Subtask 11.2: Complete and Document Practical RNA Drawing/Explanation Task
Description: Perform the practical assessment created in Task 9.2 that involves drawing RNA structures and explaining key RNA concepts.
Subtask Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Retrieve the practical assessment instructions from Task 9.2
2. Gather necessary materials (paper, drawing tools, or digital drawing tools)
3. Set aside 45-60 minutes of focused time for the practical task
4. Complete all required drawings of RNA structures (may include secondary structures, base pairing, etc.)
5. Write explanations for all required RNA concepts as specified in the assessment
6. Take clear photos/scans of hand-drawn work or save digital files
7. Compile all drawings and explanations into a single document
8. Ensure all parts of the practical assessment are complete and properly documented

Testing approach: Review the completed practical work against the original requirements to ensure all components have been addressed.

Dependencies: None

## Subtask 11.3: Self-Grade Assessments and Create Improvement Plan
Description: Using the rubrics from Task 9.3, evaluate your quiz and practical assessment performance, record results, and develop a targeted improvement plan.
Subtask Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Retrieve the grading rubrics created in Task 9.3
2. Re-review your quiz answers and apply the quiz rubric criteria
3. Evaluate your practical assessment using the practical task rubric
4. Calculate final scores for both assessments
5. Compare your initial quiz score with the rubric-based evaluation
6. Document specific strengths demonstrated in both assessments
7. Identify knowledge gaps and areas for improvement
8. Create a specific improvement plan with:
   - List of RNA concepts needing further study
   - Specific resources to review (textbook sections, videos, etc.)
   - Timeline for addressing each improvement area
   - Method to re-test understanding after review
9. Compile all assessment results and improvement plan into a final report

Testing approach: Ensure the improvement plan addresses all identified weaknesses and includes concrete, actionable steps with specific resources and timelines.
