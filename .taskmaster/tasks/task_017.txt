# Task ID: 17
# Title: OBSOLETE - See Task 19: Implement FSRS Algorithm for Spaced Repetition Scheduling
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: critical
# Description: Implement the core Free Spaced Repetition Scheduler (FSRS) algorithm in flashcore.scheduler.py to calculate card stability, difficulty, and next review date based on review history and rating.
# Details:
This task involves implementing the FSRS algorithm which is essential for the spaced repetition functionality. The implementation should:

1. Create a function that accepts two parameters: a card's review history (list of previous reviews with timestamps, ratings, etc.) and a new rating (typically on a scale of 1-4 where 1=Again, 2=Hard, 3=Good, 4=Easy).

2. Calculate the following based on the FSRS algorithm:
   - New stability value (how well the information is retained)
   - Updated difficulty value (how challenging the card is for the user)
   - Next optimal review date/time

3. The implementation should follow the mathematical model from the FSRS paper, including:
   - Forgetting curve calculation
   - Difficulty adjustment based on rating
   - Stability calculation with memory decay

4. The function should handle edge cases such as:
   - First-time reviews (no history)
   - Lapsed cards (failed reviews)
   - Very high stability cards

5. Ensure the implementation is computationally efficient as it will be called frequently during review sessions.

6. Document the code thoroughly with explanations of the algorithm steps and parameter meanings.

7. Expose appropriate configuration parameters to allow future tuning of the algorithm (e.g., forgetting curve parameters).

# Test Strategy:
Testing should verify both the correctness of the algorithm implementation and its behavior in various scenarios:

1. Unit tests:
   - Test with known input/output pairs from published FSRS examples
   - Verify all edge cases (first review, failed review, perfect recall)
   - Test boundary conditions for ratings and history lengths

2. Property-based tests:
   - Verify that higher ratings result in longer intervals
   - Confirm that repeated good ratings increase stability over time
   - Check that difficulty decreases with consistent good ratings

3. Regression tests:
   - Create a dataset of review histories and expected outputs
   - Ensure algorithm changes don't unexpectedly alter scheduling behavior

4. Performance tests:
   - Measure execution time for various history lengths
   - Ensure scheduling calculations complete within acceptable time limits

5. Integration tests:
   - Verify the scheduler interacts correctly with the card storage system
   - Test the full review workflow from card presentation to rescheduling

Create a test harness that allows visualizing the scheduling behavior over simulated review sequences to validate the algorithm produces sensible spacing intervals.
