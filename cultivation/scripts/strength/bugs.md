Symptom	Root-cause hypothesis	Suggested code probe / fix
advanced_metrics.txt reports only 0.86 km while run_summary.txt shows 3.05 km and session_full_summary.txt shows 4.42 km.	metrics.py re-computes run-only statistics after stride/walk segmentation, but the stride detector found 0 strides. As a fallback it clipped the data to the first continuous movement window (≈ 6 min).	Quick check: log len(stride_segments) and resulting slice indices. Fix: if stride_segments==0 and distance_km<1, bypass stride filter or gracefully label “insufficient run data”.
59 % “decoupling” on the 0.86 km snippet (nonsensical).	Decoupling is HR-EF drift over ≥15 min of steady running—applying it to a 6-min subsequence explodes the percentage.	Gate the decoupling calc behind: duration_min >= 15 and percent_running >= 70.
HR drift block (147→159 bpm, +8 %) yet pace negative split (7.31→6.85 min/km).	Same truncation issue: first/second “half” are each ≈ 3 min. Sample size too small, so pace split swings wildly.	Tighten min_samples in compute_hr_drift to e.g. ≥ 600 s or skip & warn.
Time-in-pace zones totals 1 215 s (≈20 min) but session duration is 4 800 s.	Walking samples above 9 min/km are clamped into pace_bin=19.5 and silently discarded when building the zone table.	Replace drop-naive filter with explicit “Walking” zone or keep >9 min/km rows for transparency.
No power data → NaN distribution yet script still prints “Power Distribution”.	No Stryd/Fn3 running power channel present.	Simple guard: if df["power"].dropna().empty: skip section.
No stride segments detected – yet cadence shows running values (152 spm).	Current stride detector uses acceleration variance threshold suitable for ≥3.0 m/s. Your drill strides are <2.8 m/s.	Lower variance threshold AND/OR integrate foot-pod cadence if available.

Take-home for devs
Add a validation layer in process_all_runs.py:

def sanity_check(metrics: dict) -> list[str]:
    issues = []
    if metrics['duration_min'] < 10 and metrics['session_type'] == 'run':
        issues.append('duration_too_short_for_run')
    if metrics['distance_km'] < 1 and metrics['percent_running'] > 20:
        issues.append('distance_vs_running_flag_mismatch')
    ...

Log the issues list to a side-car JSON so the analysis report can surface “DATA WARNING” banners instead of burying contradictions.

bug 1: 
It does look like a bug in the post-processing pipeline rather than bad GPS data:

What’s happening
– After walk/stride segmentation the code falls back to “first continuous movement window” when no strides are found.
– That slice is only ~0.86 km long, so your advanced_metrics (which sum that slice) reports 0.86 km—even though the full session is 3+ km.
Root cause
– Zero stride segments triggers the fallback.
– No guard against using a tiny slice when the full session is clearly longer.
Fix sketch
– Right after you detect stride segments, log their count and the slice indices.
– If len(stride_segments) == 0 AND the full distance (e.g. distance_cumulative_km) is ≥ 1 km, skip the stride‐filter step entirely and use the complete run for metrics.
– Otherwise, if it truly is just a tiny walk or GPS blip (< 1 km), you can label it “insufficient run data.”
Next I can:

Add a debug log in the stride‐segmentation code (probably in parse_run_files.py) to print len(stride_segments) and the window that’s chosen.
Wrap the stride-filter block in a conditional that bypasses it when no strides but total distance is large.
