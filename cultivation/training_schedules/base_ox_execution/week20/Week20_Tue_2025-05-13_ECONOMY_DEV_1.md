# Week 20 - Tuesday: Neuromuscular & Economy Development 1

**Session Focus & Type:** Neuromuscular & Economy Development 1 (Strength Focus)
**Planned Approx. Duration:** 45-60 min

## Execution Checklist:

**1. Daily Wellness Check (MANDATORY BEFORE STARTING):**
    *   Review HRV, RHR, Sleep, Recovery Score, Subjective Feel.
    *   Assign üíö Green, üíõ Amber, or ‚ù§Ô∏è Red light for today's readiness.
    *   **Proceed with adjustments below based on your readiness light.**

**2. Dynamic Warm-up (10 min):**
    *   Light cardio (jogging in place, jumping jacks).
    *   Joint Circles (ankles, knees, hips, shoulders, wrists).
    *   Leg Swings (forward/backward & side-to-side, 10-12/leg).
    *   Cat-Cow (10 reps).
    *   Bird-Dog (8-10/side, hold for 2-3s).
    *   Light Skips in place.

**3. Running Drills (High Quality Focus - 2 sets x 20-30m each):**
    *   A-Skips (focus on knee drive, dorsiflexion, quick ground contact under hips).
    *   B-Skips (A-skip motion followed by paw-back).
    *   High Knees (focus on height and frequency).
    *   Butt Kicks (focus on heel to glute, quick turnover).
    *   *Rest as needed between drills to maintain form.*

**4. Introductory Plyometrics (Focus: Landing & Form - Low Impact):**
    *   Ankle Hops (vertical, minimal knee bend, 2 sets x 10-12 reps).
    *   Pogo Jumps (in place, focus on stiffness and quick ground contact, 2 sets x 10-12 reps).
    *   Low Box Jumps (onto a very low, stable surface - 6-12 inches): 2 sets x 5-8 reps. **Focus on explosive jump up, land softly, STEP DOWN.**
    *   Standing Broad Jumps: 2 sets x 3-5 reps. **Focus on explosive jump forward, stick the landing softly, hold for 2s.**
    *   *Rest 60-90s between plyo sets. If any pain, stop that exercise.*

**5. Calisthenics Strength (Push Focus, ~20-25 min, 2-3 sets per exercise):**
    *   Incline Push-ups (or Standard if form is excellent): 8-15 reps or AMRAP.
    *   Pike Push-ups: 5-10 reps (focus shoulder strength).
    *   Dips (using chairs/bench or bars if available): 5-10 reps (bent leg or assisted if needed).
    *   Plank: 30-60 second hold.
    *   (Optional) Pseudo Planche Lean: 2-3 holds for 10-20 seconds.

**6. Cool-down (5-10 min):**
    *   Light static stretching for major muscle groups worked.

## Key Focus Points for Today:

*   **QUALITY over quantity for all drills and plyometrics.** If form degrades, stop and rest.
*   **Drills:** Exaggerate movements, focus on posture, quickness off the ground.
*   **Plyometrics:** Emphasize *soft, controlled landings*. Absorb the impact through your hips and knees. Start with very low intensity/height.
*   **Calisthenics:** Maintain strict form.

## Wellness-Based Adjustments for Today:

*   üíö **Green Light:** Proceed as planned.
*   üíõ **Amber Light:**
    *   Drills: Reduce to 1-2 sets each, focus only on perfect form.
    *   Plyometrics: Halve the sets (e.g., 1 set of each) OR do only Ankle Hops & Pogo Jumps. Remove Box Jumps/Broad Jumps if feeling particularly sluggish or sore.
    *   Calisthenics: Reduce to 2 key exercises (e.g., Incline Push-ups, Plank), 2 sets each. Focus on controlled movement, not maximal reps.
*   ‚ù§Ô∏è **Red Light:** Very light mobility/stretching only (15-20 min). **NO drills, plyos, or strength.** Consider full rest.

## Notes/Reminders:
*   This session introduces new neuromuscular stress. Listen to your body carefully.
*   Film some drill/plyo reps if possible to check form later.
