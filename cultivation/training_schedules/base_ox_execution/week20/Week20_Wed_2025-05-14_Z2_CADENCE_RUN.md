# Week 20 - Wednesday: Short Easy Z2 Run + High Cadence

**Session Focus & Type:** Short Easy Z2 Run + High Cadence
**Planned Approx. Duration (Total):** 25-30 min

## Execution Checklist:

**1. Daily Wellness Check (MANDATORY BEFORE STARTING):**
    *   Review HRV, RHR, Sleep, Recovery Score, Subjective Feel.
    *   Assign üíö Green, üíõ Amber, or ‚ù§Ô∏è Red light for today's readiness.
    *   **Proceed with adjustments below based on your readiness light.**

**2. Warm-up (5 min):**
    *   Brisk walk transitioning to very light jog.
    *   Include a few light dynamic drills (e.g., leg swings, A-skips for 10-15m).

**3. Main Run (15-20 min):**
    *   **Intensity:** Easy Zone 2 (Target HR < 160bpm, aim for 145-155bpm range).
    *   **CADENCE (PRIMARY FOCUS): Target 165-170 spm. USE METRONOME.**
    *   **Form Cues:** Run tall, light feet, quick turnover, land under hips.
    *   **Pace:** Allow pace to be an outcome of maintaining Z2 HR and target cadence. It will likely feel slow.
    *   **Walk Breaks:** Take short (15-30s) walk breaks if HR starts to exceed 158bpm, or if cadence form breaks down. Resume running when HR drops.

**4. Cool-down (5-10 min):**
    *   Gradual walk.
    *   Light static stretching for major leg muscles.

## Key Focus Points for Today:

*   **CADENCE, CADENCE, CADENCE!** This is the main technical goal of the run.
*   Relaxation at the higher cadence. Avoid tensing up.
*   Strict Z2 HR control.
*   Listen to your body after yesterday's neuromuscular work. This run should feel genuinely easy.

## Wellness-Based Adjustments for Today:

*   üíö **Green Light:** Proceed as planned (15-20 min run at Z2 HR & target cadence).
*   üíõ **Amber Light:** Reduce run to 10-12 minutes. Strict Z1 / very low Z2 HR (e.g., <150bpm). Maintain cadence focus but prioritize overall ease. More walk breaks if needed.
*   ‚ù§Ô∏è **Red Light:** 15-20 min Z1 walk *only* (no running), or full rest day.

## Notes/Reminders:
*   This run is short by design. Its purpose is aerobic touchpoint and cadence practice, not building massive endurance via volume.
*   Log average cadence from your watch.
