# Week 24 - Tuesday: Z2 Quality Volume Run

**Session Focus & Type:** Z2 Quality Volume Run
**Planned Approx. Duration:** 75-90 min

## Execution Checklist:

**1. Daily Wellness Check (MANDATORY BEFORE STARTING):**
    *   Review wellness data. Assign üíö Green, üíõ Amber, or ‚ù§Ô∏è Red light.

**2. Warm-up (5-10 min):**
    *   Brisk walk, light dynamic drills.

**3. Main Run (75-90 min):**
    *   **[ ] HR Control:** Strictly maintain HR in low-to-mid Zone 2. **Absolute cap at 158bpm.** Walk immediately if HR drifts up.
    *   **[ ] Cadence Focus:** Maintain **167-170 spm**. Use a metronome for at least the first 20-30 minutes to lock in the rhythm.
    *   **[ ] Continuous Effort:** Minimize walk breaks. The goal is to extend continuous running time under strict HR/cadence control.
    *   **[ ] Pace/EF:** These are outcomes. Do not chase a pace. The goal is to see what pace/EF your body produces under these constraints. Target EF > 0.0180.

**4. Cool-down (5-10 min):**
    *   Gradual walk, light static stretching.

## Key Focus Points for Today:

*   **Discipline:** This session tests your ability to execute a high-quality aerobic run with precision. HR and Cadence are the primary targets.
*   **Efficiency:** Feel for a light, springy, and economical stride at your target cadence.

## Wellness-Based Adjustments (G/A/R System):

*   üíö **Green Light:** Proceed as planned.
*   üíõ **Amber Light:** Reduce total duration to 50-60 min. Maintain strict HR/cadence focus.
*   ‚ù§Ô∏è **Red Light:** Replace with a 20-30 min Z1 walk or full rest. **Do not attempt this volume on a Red day.**

## System & Data Logging Instructions:

*   **Pre-Run:** Ensure watch HR alert is set to 158bpm.
*   **Post-Run:** Log subjective RPE for the session. Add notes on how cadence felt, and where/if HR control became difficult.
*   **CI/CD:** Push `.gpx`/`.fit` file. The `run-metrics` workflow will process the data. Review the `run_analysis.md` output, paying close attention to EF and Decoupling.
