# Week 24 - Thursday: Z2 Cadence & Recovery Run

**Session Focus & Type:** Z2 Cadence & Recovery Run
**Planned Approx. Duration:** 40-50 min

## Execution Checklist:

**1. Daily Wellness Check (MANDATORY):**
    *   Review wellness. Assign G/A/R light.

**2. Warm-up (5 min):**
    *   Brisk walk.

**3. Main Run (40-50 min):**
    *   **[ ] HR Control:** Strictly maintain HR in **Z1 / very low Z2 (<155bpm).** This is a recovery effort.
    *   **[ ] Cadence Focus:** Maintain **167-170 spm.** The main goal is to practice this rhythm in a non-fatigued state.
    *   **[ ] RPE:** Effort should feel very easy (RPE 2-3).

**4. Cool-down (5 min):**
    *   Walk.

## Key Focus Points for Today:

*   This is a recovery and skill-practice day, NOT a fitness-building day.
*   The feeling should be light, easy, and controlled.

## Wellness-Based Adjustments (G/A/R System):

*   💚 **Green Light:** Proceed as planned.
*   💛 **Amber Light:** Shorten duration to 25-30 min. Keep HR strictly in Z1.
*   ❤️ **Red Light:** Full rest.

## System & Data Logging Instructions:

*   Post-run, log subjective RPE. Note how easy/hard it felt to maintain cadence at this low HR.
*   Push `.gpx`/`.fit` file for processing.
