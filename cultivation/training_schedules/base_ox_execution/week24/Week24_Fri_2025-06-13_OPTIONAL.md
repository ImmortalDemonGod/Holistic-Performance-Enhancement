# Week 24 - Friday: OPTIONAL Z2 Bonus Run

**Session Focus & Type:** Optional, Very Easy Z2 Run
**Planned Approx. Duration:** 25-35 min

## Execution Checklist:

**1. Daily Wellness Check (CRITICAL - GO/NO-GO GATE):**
    *   **[ ]** Is HRV high and stable/increasing?
    *   **[ ]** Is RHR low and stable/decreasing?
    *   **[ ]** Is Whoop Recovery high Green (>85%)?
    *   **[ ]** Is subjective feeling excellent (motivated, no soreness)?
    *   **If the answer to ANY of these is NO, DO NOT RUN. Take a full rest day.**

**2. IF EXECUTING (All checks must be YES):**
    *   **[ ] Duration:** 25-35 min total.
    *   **[ ] HR Control:** **Strictly < 155bpm.**
    *   **[ ] Purpose:** Shakeout, promote blood flow. This run should make you feel better, not more tired.

## Key Focus Points for Today:

*   This is a "bonus," not a requirement. Skipping it is the default, correct choice if there is any doubt.
*   The goal is to not add any meaningful fatigue before Saturday.

## Wellness-Based Adjustments (G/A/R System):

*   💚 **Green Light (and feeling exceptional):** Proceed with caution.
*   💛 **Amber Light:** **SKIP. Full Rest.**
*   ❤️ **Red Light:** **SKIP. Full Rest.**

## System & Data Logging Instructions:

*   If you run, log it as usual. Note in your subjective log why you made the decision to run.
