## Summary
### Description

This pull request implements the foundational project-wide task runner as specified in **DW_IA_TOOLING_001**. The goal is to standardize all common development and operational commands, reduce cognitive load, and ensure consistency between local development and CI environments.

Go Task (`Taskfile.yml`) was selected over Makefile for its superior cross-platform compatibility, readable YAML syntax, and built-in discoverability features, aligning with the project's long-term goals for maintainability and collaboration.

Addresses Task: `14`

### Execution Analysis: Predicted vs Actual

**Time Estimation Performance:**
- **Initial Prediction:** 4-6 hours (240-360 minutes)
- **Actual Execution:** 1 hour 45 minutes (105 minutes)
- **Variance:** -56% to -69% (completed in ~1/3 to 1/2 of predicted time)

**Key Factors in Variance:**
1. **High Developer Proficiency:** Rapid resolution of environmental issues (Go Task install), YAML syntax errors, and script debugging
2. **Low Friction Implementation:** Go Task's simplicity and YAML syntax accelerated development vs Makefile
3. **Mature Underlying Scripts:** Existing scripts required minimal refactoring for task integration
4. **Conservative Prediction Model:** Original estimate included excessive buffer time for debugging

**Lessons for Future Estimation:** The actual time of ~1.75 hours should serve as a more accurate baseline for similar "high-impact infrastructure tooling" tasks.

### Key Changes & Rationale

-   **Added `Taskfile.yml`:** The new single source of truth for all project commands. It is heavily documented with `desc:` fields for each task, making it self-discoverable via `task --list-all`.
-   **Standardized Command Namespaces:** Implemented tasks for all critical development lifecycle stages:
    -   `setup`: Environment and dependency installation.
    -   `lint`: Python and Markdown linting.
    -   `test`: Pytest suite execution.
    -   `docs`: Building, serving, and deploying the MkDocs site.
    -   `run`: Wrapper commands for key data pipelines and automation scripts.
    -   `clean`: Removing temporary files and caches.
-   **CodeScene Integration:** Went beyond the initial plan to add a full suite of `codescene` tasks for static analysis, providing a powerful new quality assurance tool.
-   **Updated `README.md`:** The root README has been updated with a comprehensive section detailing how to install and use the new task runner, simplifying the onboarding process.
-   **CI Workflow Refactoring:** The `.github/workflows/markdown-lint.yml` has been updated to use `task lint:md` as a proof-of-concept for CI integration.

### Scope Expansion Beyond Original Plan

**Additional Value Delivered:**
- **CodeScene CLI Integration:** Added comprehensive static analysis capabilities with `codescene:check`, `codescene:review`, and `codescene:delta` tasks
- **Enhanced Documentation Generation:** Created `docs:gen-nav` task with automatic dependency integration for `docs:deploy`
- **Script Debugging & Fixes:** Identified and resolved issues in `github_automation.sh` output path during integration testing
- **Environment Variable Documentation:** Added critical `.env` export instructions for `task-master` compatibility

### How to Test This Change

1.  Check out this branch: `git checkout chore/add-task-runner`
2.  Install Go Task if you haven't already (see updated `README.md`).
3.  Set up the environment using the new task: `task setup`
4.  Activate the environment: `source .venv/bin/activate`
5.  Verify key tasks execute correctly:
    -   `task test` (should run the pytest suite)
    -   `task lint` (should run ruff and pymarkdown)
    -   `task docs` (should start the MkDocs local server)
    -   `task --list-all` (should show all available tasks with descriptions)
6.  Review the new `README.md` section for clarity and accuracy.

### Impact on Project Roadmap

This PR completes a critical **Phase 0 ("Operational Bedrock")** milestone, establishing the foundation for:
- Consistent development workflows across team members
- Simplified CI/CD pipeline maintenance
- Reduced onboarding friction for new contributors
- Standardized quality assurance processes

Recommended next steps: **DW_IA_PRECOMMIT_001** (Pre-commit hooks) to build upon this task runner foundation.
