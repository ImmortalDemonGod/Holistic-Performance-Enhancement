## Summary
This foundational pull request marks the official kickoff of the 5-month ARC Prize 2025 sprint. It introduces a new, robust two-track development strategy, enacts a major architectural refactoring to improve system modularity, and introduces significant developer experience enhancements.

### 🚀 **Strategic Initiative: ARC Prize 2025 Sprint**

This PR formalizes the strategic decision to pursue the ARC Prize, pivoting to a de-risked, two-track development approach that leverages the mature `JARC-Reactor` codebase in parallel with the visionary `george` cognitive architecture.

- **New Strategic Documents:** Introduces the canonical strategy, architecture, and execution plans for the sprint:
    - `Strategic_Integration_of_ARC_Prize_2025_v2.0.md`: The "Why." Outlines the two-track strategy to de-risk development and maximize the chances of a top-tier submission.
    - `ARC_Prize_2025_Two_Track_Execution_Plan_v2.md`: The "What & When." Details the phased milestones for both development tracks.
    - `PROMETHEUS_ARCHIMEDES_Architecture_v1.0.md`: The "How." The technical blueprint for the final hybrid solver.
- **New `arc_agi_plan.json`:** A machine-readable deep work plan that contains the full list of tasks for the ARC sprint.
- **EPIC Task for `jarc-reactor` Integration:** A new, detailed epic task (`#16`) has been added to `tasks.json` to manage the complex process of integrating the `jarc-reactor` codebase, including subtasks, risk analysis, and mitigation plans.

### 🏗️ **Major Architectural Refactoring**

To support growing complexity and clarify the system's structure, a major refactoring has been performed:
- **New `cultivation/systems/` Directory:** A top-level `systems/` directory has been created to house core, reusable systems.
- **Consolidated Knowledge System:** The entire Literature Pipeline, Instrumented Reader App, and associated schemas have been moved from disparate locations into a single, unified `cultivation/systems/knowledge/` module. This correctly positions it as a first-class component of the Cultivation architecture.
- **Reorganized Scripts:** Utility scripts have been moved to `cultivation/scripts/utilities/` and exploratory notebooks have been promoted to operational scripts to reflect their mature status.

### ✨ **Developer Experience & Repository Health**

- **Reduced Repository Size:** The vendored `pdfjs` third-party library has been removed from `cultivation/systems/knowledge/reader_app/static/`, significantly reducing the repository's clone size and simplifying dependency management.
- **Enhanced Task Files:** A new script, `enhance_task_files.py`, has been introduced to automatically append detailed subtask information from `tasks.json` to the individual `task_XXX.txt` files. This greatly improves the readability and utility of the task files.
- **General Cleanup:** Removed numerous placeholder files, old `TODOs`, and temporary analysis reports to reduce clutter.

### 🧠 **Knowledge System & Learning Loop Enhancements**

- **Automated Quiz Generation Prototype:** Includes a new prototype (`Entity_generated_quiz.md`) for generating assessment questions from a knowledge graph, demonstrating a key Knowledge Creation & Validation (KCV) capability.
- **Self-Assessment Logging:** Adds a log of a completed RNA pre-test (`2025-06-10_..._PreTest_Answers.md`), demonstrating the active use of the learning feedback loop and providing valuable data for the Potential (Π) engine.

### 📊 **Execution Time Analysis**

**Project Structure Refactoring:**
- **Predicted Effort:** 2-3 days of intensive refactoring work
- **Actual Execution:** Completed systematically over multiple focused sessions
- **Key Success Factors:** 
  - Methodical approach to architectural changes
  - Careful preservation of functionality during moves
  - Integration with existing task runner infrastructure

**Strategic Planning & Documentation:**
- **Predicted Effort:** 1-2 days for comprehensive strategy development
- **Actual Execution:** Thorough analysis and multi-version iteration
- **Value Delivered:** Complete strategic framework for 5-month sprint

### 🔍 **How to Review**

1.  **Review the Strategic Shift:** Start by reading the new strategic documents in `cultivation/docs/WORK_IN_PROGRESS/` to understand the rationale behind the two-track ARC plan.
2.  **Examine the New Architecture:** Check the new `cultivation/systems/` directory and see how the Knowledge System components are now organized.
3.  **Inspect the ARC EPIC Task:** Review `tasks/task_016.txt` and its corresponding entry in `tasks/tasks.json` to understand the detailed plan for integrating `jarc-reactor`.
4.  **Verify DX Improvements:** Note the removal of the `pdfjs` directory and observe the enhanced content in the `tasks/` text files. You can re-run `python cultivation/scripts/task_management/enhance_task_files.py` to verify its behavior.

### 📈 **Impact Assessment**

This PR establishes the strategic direction and architectural foundation for the next five months of intensive development. It represents:
- **Strategic Clarity:** Clear roadmap for ARC Prize competition
- **Architectural Maturity:** Transition from scripts to systems
- **Developer Productivity:** Enhanced tooling and cleaner structure
- **Learning Loop Activation:** Demonstrated use of KCV capabilities
