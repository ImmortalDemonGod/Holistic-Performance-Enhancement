## CodeRabbit Walkthrough
## Walkthrough

This update introduces extensive documentation, structured training plans, and a large set of new output data files related to running analysis. It adds new design documents for knowledge systems and formal verification tools, implements robust data handling in scripts, and includes a comprehensive week of training plans with detailed daily instructions and supporting literature reviews. Numerous output files summarize running session metrics, distributions, and weather data.

## Changes

| File(s) | Change Summary |
|---------|---------------|
| `cultivation/README.md` | Added a comprehensive project README detailing goals, pillars, methodology, stack, and challenges. |
| `cultivation/docs/2_requirements/lean_tools.md` | Introduced a document summarizing DeepSeek-Prover-V2 features, benchmarks, usage, and caveats. |
