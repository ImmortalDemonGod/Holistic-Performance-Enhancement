## Summary
#### **1. Summary & Rationale**

This pull request introduces the **Mentat Cognitive Augmentation Domain**, a new core pillar of the "Cultivation" project. It formalizes the previously discussed concepts of "Training the Mind Like a Machine" and the "Mentat-OS" into a structured, actionable framework.

The primary rationale for this change is to move beyond ad-hoc cognitive drills and establish a systematic, measurable, and evidence-based curriculum for enhancing cognitive performance. This new domain is designed to be deeply integrated with the project's Holistic Integration Layer (HIL), providing a rich new data stream for the Potential (Π) and Synergy engines and creating a powerful human-AI partnership model.

This PR lays the complete foundational groundwork for the new domain by introducing five core documents that define its architecture, training protocols, data contracts, and implementation plan.

---

#### **2. Key Changes & New Documents Added**

This PR introduces the following new files:

*   **`cultivation/docs/5_domain_knowledge_and_curricula/cognitive_augmentation/README.md`**
    *   **Purpose:** The central entry point and table of contents for the new domain. Provides a mission statement and navigational links to the other core documents.

*   **`cultivation/docs/5_domain_knowledge_and_curricula/cognitive_augmentation/mentat_os_blueprint.md`**
    *   **Purpose:** The architectural charter for the Mentat-OS. Details the 5-layer cognitive architecture (Intuition, Cognitive Core, Somatic, Social, Governance), its guiding principles, and its strategic mapping to the Cultivation Ranking System.

*   **`cultivation/docs/5_domain_knowledge_and_curricula/cognitive_augmentation/drill_cookbook.md`**
    *   **Purpose:** The practical, version-controlled training manual. Provides step-by-step procedures, progression ladders, and measurable KPIs for each of the cognitive drills designed to train the five layers of the Mentat-OS.

*   **`cultivation/docs/2_requirements_and_specifications/data_schemas/cognitive_training_schemas.md`**
    *   **Purpose:** The technical data contract for the domain. It specifies the schemas for the raw `cognitive_drill_log.csv` and the processed `cognitive_training_weekly.parquet` files, ensuring data integrity for the ETL pipeline.

*   **`cultivation/docs/5_domain_knowledge_and_curricula/cognitive_augmentation/mentat_os_pilot_plan.md`**
    *   **Purpose:** The actionable project plan for the initial 4-week MVP pilot. It outlines the schedule, success criteria, and a concrete integration roadmap with `DW_` task identifiers for implementation.

#### **3. Modified Files**

*   **`cultivation/docs/5_domain_knowledge_and_curricula/README.md`**
    *   **Change:** Updated to formally include the "Cognitive Augmentation" domain in the top-level list of curricula, ensuring it is discoverable and properly positioned within the project's knowledge base.

---

#### **4. Impact on the "Cultivation" System**

*   **Architectural Impact:** Establishes a new, major functional domain within the project. It provides a clear blueprint for subsequent development of ETL scripts, HIL integration, and scheduling features related to cognitive training.
*   **Data Pipeline Impact:** Defines the new `ETL_CognitiveTraining` pipeline and its associated data artifacts (`cognitive_drill_log.csv`, `cognitive_training_weekly.parquet`).
*   **Strategic Impact:** This is a significant step towards realizing the project's grand ambitions, particularly "Enhance Human Potential." It provides the framework for systematically improving the human operator's cognitive capabilities, which acts as a force multiplier for all other domains.

---

#### **5. Next Steps & Implementation Plan**

The approval and merge of this PR marks the completion of the *planning and design phase* for the Mentat-OS. The immediate next steps are to execute the **4-Week MVP Pilot Plan**, which involves:

1.  **Scaffolding:** Creating the necessary directory structures and script files (`mentat_autograder.py`, etc.).
2.  **Instrumentation:** Setting up the KPI dashboard for data logging.
3.  **Baseline Testing:** Conducting Day-0 baseline measurements for all relevant cognitive KPIs.
4.  **Initiating Training:** Beginning the daily drill protocol as outlined in the `drill_cookbook.md` and `pilot_plan.md`.

These implementation tasks will be tracked via `DW_` tasks in the project's `tasks.json` file.

---

#### **6. Review Checklist**

*   [x] All new documents are internally consistent and cross-referenced.
*   [x] The new domain is correctly integrated into the existing documentation structure.
*   [x] The proposed changes align with the overall vision and architecture of the "Cultivation" project.
*   [ ] (Reviewer) Confirm that the defined data schemas are sufficient for the initial data pipeline.
*   [ ] (Reviewer) Confirm that the pilot plan is clear and actionable.

### **🧠 Mentat-OS Architecture Overview**

This PR introduces a systematic 5-layer cognitive architecture:

1. **Intuition Engine** - Pattern recognition and rapid inference capabilities
2. **Cognitive Core** - Working memory, logical reasoning, and executive control
3. **Somatic Interface** - Mind-body integration and interoceptive awareness
4. **Social Engine** - Interpersonal cognition and emotional intelligence
5. **Ethical Governor** - Value alignment and long-term consequence evaluation

### **📊 Key Performance Indicators Established**

- **Working Memory Span**: Measured through digit span and N-back tasks
- **Pattern Recognition Speed**: Visual and conceptual pattern identification metrics
- **Logical Reasoning Accuracy**: Inference and deduction performance tracking
- **Interoceptive Accuracy**: Body awareness and somatic intelligence measurement
- **Social Cognition**: Theory of mind and emotional intelligence assessment

### **🎯 4-Week MVP Pilot Success Criteria**

- Complete 80% of scheduled training sessions (19/24 sessions)
- Achieve measurable improvement in at least 3 core KPIs
- Establish reliable baseline measurements for all 5 cognitive layers
- Demonstrate data pipeline functionality and integration capability

This foundational PR establishes the strategic framework for systematic cognitive enhancement, creating a new domain that will serve as a force multiplier across all other areas of the Cultivation ecosystem.
