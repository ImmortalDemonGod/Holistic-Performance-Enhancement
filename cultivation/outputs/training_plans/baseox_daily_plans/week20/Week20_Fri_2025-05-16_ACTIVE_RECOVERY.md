# Week 20 - Friday: Active Recovery & Mobility Focus

**Session Focus & Type:** Active Recovery & Mobility
**Planned Approx. Duration:** 20-30 min

## Execution Checklist:

**1. Daily Wellness Check (MANDATORY BEFORE STARTING):**
    *   Review HRV, RHR, Sleep, Recovery Score, Subjective Feel (especially after yesterday's intensity).
    *   Assign üíö Green, üíõ Amber, or ‚ù§Ô∏è Red light for today's readiness.

**2. Main Activity (Choose one or a combination):**
    *   **Option 1: Gentle Walk (20-30 min)**
        *   Very easy pace (Z1 HR, conversational).
        *   Focus on relaxed movement.
    *   **Option 2: Dedicated Mobility/Foam Rolling/Stretching Session (20-30 min)**
        *   Full body foam rolling.
        *   Static stretches for major muscle groups (quads, hamstrings, calves, glutes, hips, chest, back). Hold each stretch 30-60 seconds.
        *   Light yoga or dynamic mobility routine (e.g., cat-cows, bird-dogs, hip circles, thoracic rotations).
    *   **Option 3: Combination**
        *   10-15 min gentle walk + 10-15 min stretching/foam rolling.

## Key Focus Points for Today:

*   **Promote Blood Flow:** The goal is light movement to aid recovery, not to add training stress.
*   **Listen to Your Body:** If feeling very fatigued from yesterday, keep this extremely light or opt for more passive recovery (e.g., just stretching).
*   **No Impact or Strain.**

## Wellness-Based Adjustments for Today:

*   üíö **Green Light:** Proceed as planned with your chosen option.
*   üíõ **Amber Light:** Keep the activity very light and potentially shorter (e.g., 15-20 min). Prioritize stretching/foam rolling over a longer walk if feeling tired.
*   ‚ù§Ô∏è **Red Light:** Full rest day is likely best. If desperate for movement, a very short (10-15 min) gentle walk or just some light static stretches.

## Notes/Reminders:
*   This is an important day for recovery after intensity. Don't skip it or turn it into a workout.
*   Prepare for tomorrow's Neuromuscular & Economy session.
