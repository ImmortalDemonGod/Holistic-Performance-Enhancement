# Week 20 - Sunday: Optional Very Easy Run OR Full Rest

**Session Focus & Type:** Optional Very Easy Run OR Full Rest
**Planned Approx. Duration:** 0 OR 20-30 min (Total if running)

## Execution Checklist:

**1. Daily Wellness Check (MANDATORY BEFORE DECIDING):**
    *   Review HRV, RHR, Sleep, Recovery Score, Subjective Feel.
    *   Assign 💚 Green, 💛 Amber, or ❤️ Red light for today's readiness.
    *   **The decision to run today is ENTIRELY dependent on a strong 💚 Green Light and feeling genuinely good and recovered.**

**2. IF RUNNING (Only on 💚 Green Light & Feeling Excellent):**
    *   **Warm-up (5 min):** Gentle walk.
    *   **Run (15-20 min):**
        *   **Intensity:** Strictly Z1 or very low Z2 (Target HR < 150bpm, aim for 135-145bpm). This should feel exceptionally easy.
        *   **Cadence Focus:** **165-170 spm (METRONOME ON).** Maintain focus on light, quick steps even at very slow pace.
        *   **Form Cues:** Relaxed, smooth.
        *   **Pace:** Very slow, purely an outcome of HR and cadence.
    *   **Cool-down (5 min):** Walk.

**3. IF NOT RUNNING (Amber/Red Light, or if any doubt even on Green):**
    *   **Full Rest.**
    *   Focus on nutrition, hydration, sleep, light stretching if desired.

## Key Focus Points for Today:

*   **RECOVERY IS THE PRIORITY.** This run is truly optional and only if all signs point to excellent recovery and readiness.
*   If running, the goal is light movement and continued cadence practice, not fitness building.
*   There is no shame in taking a full rest day; it's often the smarter choice.

## Wellness-Based Adjustments for Today:

*   💚 **Green Light & Feeling GREAT:** Proceed with optional short, very easy run as described.
*   💛 **Amber Light:** **Opt for FULL REST.** Do not run.
*   ❤️ **Red Light:** **FULL REST.**

## Notes/Reminders:
*   Be honest with your self-assessment. This is the end of a week with new stimuli.
*   Log wellness metrics regardless of activity choice.
*   Prepare for the upcoming week based on how this week felt and how recovery trends.
