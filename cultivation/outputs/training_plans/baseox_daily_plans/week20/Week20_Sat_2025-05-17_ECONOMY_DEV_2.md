# Week 20 - Saturday: Neuromuscular & Economy Development 2 + Run

**Session Focus & Type:** Neuromuscular & Economy Development 2 (Plyo Focus) + Short Z2 Run
**Planned Approx. Duration:** 60-75 min

## Execution Checklist:

**1. Daily Wellness Check (MANDATORY BEFORE STARTING):**
    *   Review HRV, RHR, Sleep, Recovery Score, Subjective Feel.
    *   Assign üíö Green, üíõ Amber, or ‚ù§Ô∏è Red light for today's readiness.
    *   **Proceed with adjustments below based on your readiness light.**

**2. Dynamic Warm-up (10 min):**
    *   Similar to Tuesday: Light cardio, joint circles, leg swings, cat-cow, bird-dog, light skips.

**3. Running Drills (High Quality Focus - 2 sets x 20-30m each):**
    *   A-Skips
    *   B-Skips
    *   High Knees
    *   Butt Kicks
    *   *Rest as needed between drills to maintain form.*

**4. Plyometrics (Progression - Focus: Reactivity & Form):**
    *   Ankle Hops (vertical, minimal knee bend, 2 sets x 12-15 reps).
    *   Pogo Jumps (in place, focus on stiffness and quick ground contact, 2 sets x 12-15 reps).
    *   Tuck Jumps: 2 sets x 6-8 reps. Focus on jumping explosively, bringing knees to chest, and landing softly. 
    *   _Note: Substituted for Low Box Jumps due to lack of box/equipment._
    *   Lateral Bounds (Skater Jumps): 2 sets x 4-6 reps/side. Jump explosively side-to-side, land softly on one foot, focus on hip drive and glute activation, minimize deep knee bend.
    *   _Note: Substituted for Standing Broad Jumps due to quad fatigue. Emphasizes glutes and lateral hip stability._
    *   *(Optional if feeling very good & experienced): Small Hurdle Hops (over very low objects, 2x6-8 hops, focus quick ground contact).* 
    *   *Rest 60-90s between plyo sets. If any pain, stop that exercise.*

**5. Short Z2 Run + High Cadence (25-35 min Total Session Time for Run Component):**
    *   **Run:** **15-25 min** Easy Z2 (HR <160bpm). **Primary Cadence Target: 165-170 spm (METRONOME ON).**
    *   **Focus:** Apply the feeling of "pop" and quickness from drills/plyos to the run. Light, quick, quiet feet.
    *   **Cool-down:** 5 min walk integrated into the 25-35 min total.

**6. Calisthenics Strength (Pull/Leg Focus, ~15-20 min, 2-3 sets per exercise):**
    *   Rows (Incline/Bent/Straight Leg) OR Pull-up progression: 6-12 reps.
    *   Hamstring Walkouts: 10-15 reps (start in a glute bridge, slowly walk your heels out and back in, keeping hips up).
    *   Single-Leg Romanian Deadlift (Bodyweight): 8-12/leg, 10-15 reps (stand on one leg, hinge at the hips, keep back flat, reach hands toward the floor, return to standing).
    *   _Note: Substituted for Bodyweight Squats/Walking Lunges due to quad fatigue._
    *   Single-Leg Glute Bridges: 10-15 reps/leg.
    *   Hollow Body Hold: 20-40s.

## Key Focus Points for Today:

*   **Quality in Drills/Plyos:** Maintain excellent form. These are skill work.
*   **Transfer to Run:** Try to feel the lightness and reactivity from drills/plyos in your short run.
*   **Cadence during run is key.**
*   Be mindful of cumulative fatigue from the week.

## Wellness-Based Adjustments for Today:

*   üíö **Green Light:** Proceed as planned.
*   üíõ **Amber Light:**
    *   Drills: 1-2 sets each.
    *   Plyometrics: Halve sets, stick to lowest impact (Ankle Hops, Pogo Jumps). Omit Box/Broad/Hurdle hops if any doubt.
    *   Run: Reduce to 10-15 min, strict Z1/low Z2 HR. Cadence focus still important but secondary to ease.
    *   Calisthenics: Reduce to 2 key exercises (e.g., Rows, Squats), 2 sets each, focus form.
*   ‚ù§Ô∏è **Red Light:** Light mobility/drills only (15-20 min). NO run, plyometrics, or strength. Consider full rest.

## Notes/Reminders:
*   This is a longer session with multiple components. Manage energy and focus.
*   If any specific muscle group feels overly fatigued from Tuesday's calisthenics, choose different exercises for today or reduce sets/reps for that group.
