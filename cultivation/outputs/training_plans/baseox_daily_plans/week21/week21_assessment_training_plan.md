You've made an excellent point. My previous suggestion was too conservative and didn't sufficiently emphasize *assessing the impact* of the four weeks of training already completed. The goal is indeed to systematically improve, and part of that system involves re-calibrating to understand the current state after a block of work.

Your proposal to include:
1.  A repeat of an RPE 10 effort (like from Week 17).
2.  An NME (Neuromuscular Economy) session (like from Week 20).
3.  A controlled Zone 2 HR session.
...all within Week 21, with recovery, is a much better approach for an "Assessment & Re-Calibration Week." This allows for measuring changes across different facets of fitness.

**Revised Plan for Week 21: Assessment & Re-Calibration**

This plan aims to directly measure the effects of the Wk17-20 training. **Crucially, each assessment session is contingent on adequate wellness (Green or very strong Amber light). If wellness is poor, the assessment for that day should be postponed or significantly modified to avoid invalidating results or causing undue stress.**

*   **Monday (Day 1): Full Rest & Active Recovery Preparedness.**
    *   **Activity:** Full rest or very light mobility/stretching.
    *   **Focus:** Maximize recovery. Log all wellness metrics. Mentally prepare for Tuesday's RPE 10 effort. Ensure hydration and nutrition are optimal.

*   **Tuesday (Day 2): Assessment 1 - Max Effort/RPE 10 Run.**
    *   **Session Plan:**
        *   Warm-up: 10-15 min easy jog, dynamic drills, 2-3 strides.
        *   **Main Set: Aim to replicate the conditions and intent of the Week 17 RPE 10 run (`20250425_201748_afternoon_run_calibration_pre-baseox_RPE_10`).** This means running to a perceived RPE of 10 for a similar duration (e.g., ~40 minutes of running effort, allowing for walk breaks if that was part of the original protocol or becomes necessary).
        *   Focus on pushing to a true maximal sustainable effort for that timeframe.
        *   Cool-down: 10-15 min easy jog/walk.
    *   **Data to Capture & Compare (vs. Wk17 RPE 10 Run):**
        *   Total distance covered (running segments).
        *   Total duration of running segments.
        *   Average Pace, HR, Cadence for running segments.
        *   Efficiency Factor (EF) for running segments.
        *   HR Decoupling for running segments.
        *   Max HR achieved.
        *   Time in HR Zones.
        *   Subjective feel, comparison to Wk17 effort.
        *   Environmental conditions (Temperature is key – target Wk17's 20.4°C if possible, or note deviation).
    *   **Wellness Gate:** If not Green Light, postpone or replace with an easy Z1/Z2 run. An RPE 10 test on compromised readiness is not a valid assessment.

*   **Wednesday (Day 3): Active Recovery.**
    *   **Activity:** Very light Z1 walk (20-30 min) or complete rest.
    *   **Focus:** Recovery from RPE 10 effort. Monitor wellness response.

*   **Thursday (Day 4): Assessment 2 - NME Session Benchmark.**
    *   **Session Plan:** (Based on Wk20 NME1 or NME2, e.g., `Week20_Tue_2025-05-13_ECONOMY_DEV_1.md` or `Week20_Sat_2025-05-17_ECONOMY_DEV_2.md`)
        *   Dynamic Warm-up (10 min).
        *   Running Drills: 2 sets each (A-Skips, B-Skips, High Knees, etc.), focus on quality.
        *   Plyometrics: Select 2-3 key exercises from Wk20 (e.g., Ankle Hops, Pogo Jumps, Tuck Jumps). Perform 2 sets of planned reps. Assess form (video if possible), RPE, perceived power/reactivity.
        *   Calisthenics: Select 2-3 key exercises from Wk20 (e.g., Push-ups, Dips/Rows, Plank). Perform 1-2 sets aiming for RPE 8-9 or max good-form reps.
        *   Cool-down.
    *   **Data to Capture & Compare (vs. Wk20 NME sessions):**
        *   RPE for drills, plyos, calisthenics.
        *   Reps/duration achieved for calisthenics at target RPE.
        *   Qualitative notes on form, coordination, power in plyos.
        *   Any HR spikes (if HR monitored).
    *   **Wellness Gate:** If recovery from Tue is poor (Amber/Red), significantly reduce NME volume/intensity (e.g., drills only, 1 set of light plyos) or postpone.

*   **Friday (Day 5): Active Recovery.**
    *   **Activity:** Very light Z1 walk (20-30 min) or complete rest.
    *   **Focus:** Recovery. Monitor wellness.

*   **Saturday (Day 6): Assessment 3 - Controlled Zone 2 HR Run.**
    *   **Session Plan:**
        *   Warm-up: 5-10 min light activity.
        *   **Main Set: 25-35 minutes continuous running.**
        *   **Strict HR Control:** Average HR 145-155bpm (absolute cap 160bpm).
        *   **Cadence Target:** 165-170 spm (use metronome only if needed to hit target, try to maintain without).
        *   Environment: Aim for cooler conditions if possible, flat/familiar route.
        *   Pace is an outcome.
        *   Cool-down: 5-10 min.
    *   **Data to Capture & Compare (vs. Wk18 Thu Z2, Wk19 Z2 segments, Wk20 failed Z2 attempts):**
        *   Avg Pace achieved at Z2 HR.
        *   Efficiency Factor (EF).
        *   HR Drift (PwvHR).
        *   Avg Cadence (and use of metronome).
        *   RPE for the Z2 effort.
        *   Time in HR Zones (should be predominantly Z2).
    *   **Wellness Gate:** If not Green/Strong Amber, this session must be modified (shorter, strict Z1) or postponed. A true Z2 assessment requires decent readiness.

*   **Sunday (Day 7): Full Rest.**
    *   Analyze data from the week.
    *   Plan Week 22 based on assessment outcomes.

**Rationale for this Assessment Week Structure:**

*   **Direct Comparison (RPE 10):** Measures changes in higher-end performance capacity. The Wk17 RPE 10 run involved:
    *   `20250425_201748_afternoon_run_calibration_pre-baseox_RPE_10`:
        *   Run-Only segment (from `advanced_metrics.txt`): 7.83 km, 39.4 min, Avg Pace 5.03 min/km, Avg HR 183.6, EF 0.01804, Decoupling 7.72%.
        *   Full session (from `session_full_summary.txt`): 8.3 km, 46.7 min, Avg Pace 5.62 min/km, Avg HR 181.7.
*   **NME Check-in:** Assesses qualitative and minor quantitative changes from the introduction of NME work.
*   **Aerobic Base Test (Z2 Run):** Directly tests the primary goal of the "Base-Ox" phase and the impact of recent cadence work on Z2 efficiency.
*   **Addresses Previous Shortcomings:** By emphasizing wellness gating and controlled conditions for assessments, it aims for more valid data than some of the compromised sessions in Wk19-20.

**How the Results of Week 21 will Inform the Next Training Block (Week 22+):**

1.  **RPE 10 Run Assessment:**
    *   **Improved Performance (faster pace for similar HR/duration/RPE, or longer duration/distance at similar HR/pace/RPE, better EF):** Suggests positive adaptation to the overall training load, even if fragmented. May allow for cautiously introducing more structured intensity or slightly increasing overall volume.
    *   **Similar Performance:** Indicates maintenance. The focus might need to remain on foundational qualities (aerobic base, NME).
    *   **Decreased Performance:** A strong signal that the previous 4 weeks, despite the work, did not lead to positive high-end adaptation, possibly due to insufficient recovery, misdirected intensity, or the NME work not yet translating. This would necessitate a very conservative approach, likely focusing heavily on true Z2 work and NME consolidation.

2.  **NME Session Assessment:**
    *   **Improved Form/Coordination/RPE for same work:** Shows positive adaptation to NME. Can continue progressing NME load/complexity.
    *   **Stagnation or Regressed Performance/Form:** May indicate NME load was too high too soon, or recovery is insufficient. Might need to simplify NME or reduce its frequency/intensity.

3.  **Controlled Zone 2 HR Run Assessment:**
    *   **Pace at Z2 HR Faster, EF Higher, RPE Lower, Drift Lower (than previous comparable Z2 efforts):** Strong positive sign. Indicates aerobic base and efficiency are improving. Allows for gradually increasing Z2 run duration and potentially starting to explore slightly higher Z2 HRs (e.g., 150-160bpm range more consistently).
    *   **Pace at Z2 HR Similar/Slower, EF Stagnant/Lower, RPE High, Drift High:** Indicates the aerobic base is still weak and efficiency is poor. The primary focus *must remain* on true Z2 running at whatever slow pace is necessary, NME work for economy, and strict G/A/R adherence. Further volume/intensity increases would be counterproductive. Cadence work continues.

4.  **Overall Wellness Response during Wk21:**
    *   If wellness remains stable/positive throughout a week with 3 distinct assessment stressors, it indicates good resilience.
    *   If wellness deteriorates, it suggests current overall load (even assessment load) is too high or recovery practices (sleep consistency!) are still major limiters.

This "Assessment & Re-Calibration Week" directly addresses your valid concern about understanding the *effect* of the training. It provides concrete data points to guide the next phase, moving beyond simply repeating a previous week's structure.
