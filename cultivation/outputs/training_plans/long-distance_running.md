Training Volume, Intensity, and Performance in Long-Distance Running

1. Casado et al. (2021) Findings vs. Other Studies

1.1 Casado et al. (2021) – Key Findings on Volume and Intensity

Casado et al. (2021) analyzed the first 7 years of training in 85 elite male long-distance runners (5000 m to marathon) and identified which training factors best predicted performance ￼. Performance was quantified via IAAF scoring tables for personal bests. The volume of easy runs emerged as a strong predictor of success (Pearson r ~0.68–0.72) ￼. Among higher-intensity workouts (considered “deliberate practice” by the authors), tempo runs (continuous runs at ~half-marathon pace) showed a significant moderate correlation with performance (r ~0.50–0.58), as did short-interval training (r ~0.53–0.56) ￼. In contrast, long-interval training (longer reps at 5k–10k pace) had a much weaker relationship (r ~0.22–0.31) ￼. A hierarchical regression confirmed that, after accounting for total training volume, the mileage from easy runs and tempo runs together explained ~57% of the variance in performance (p < 0.01) ￼. The authors concluded that while intensive workouts (tempo runs and intervals) are important, the “non-deliberate” volume of easy running is crucial for top performance, in part because it contributes the bulk of an athlete’s total distance ￼.

1.2 Supporting Evidence from Other Studies (Confirmations)

Casado’s findings align with a broad body of research underscoring the importance of high training volume and a large proportion of low-intensity work for endurance performance. Observational studies of world-class endurance athletes consistently show they perform 70–80% of their training at low intensity (below the first lactate/ventilatory threshold) ￼. This “high-mileage, low-intensity” approach has been associated with optimal performance development in long-distance events ￼ ￼. Indeed, it is rare to find modern elite runners logging under 100 km per week; most run well above 160 km/week during base training ￼, emphasizing the importance of sheer volume.

Crucially, experimental evidence also supports emphasizing easy volume. In a 5-month randomized trial, Esteve-Lanao et al. (2007) had sub-elite runners follow either a high-volume “polarized” program (~80% low intensity, ~12% moderate, ~8% high) or a more “threshold-focused” program (~67% low, ~25% moderate, ~8% high) with equal total training load ￼. Both groups did the same amount of high-intensity work, but the polarized group ran more easy miles. Results: the polarized (high easy-volume) group improved 10k performance significantly more (–157 ± 13 s vs. –121.5 ± 7 s, p = 0.03) ￼. This provides causal evidence that a larger percentage of low-intensity running leads to greater performance gains, so long as some high-intensity stimulus is present ￼. Similarly, Muñoz et al. (2014) found a 10-week polarized program (~77% low, 3% moderate, 20% high by HR zone) produced slightly larger 10 km improvement in recreational runners (–5.0%) than a threshold-heavy program (~40% low, 50% moderate, 10% high, –3.5%), though differences were not statistically significant ￼ ￼. These studies reinforce Casado’s message: “more easy running” tends to correlate with better long-distance outcomes, confirming the value of high aerobic base volume ￼ ￼.

Notably, Casado et al.’s identification of tempo (threshold) training as a key predictor is echoed by other research highlighting the importance of lactate-threshold intensity. The running speed at lactate threshold (vLT2 or MLSS) has a very strong correlation with race performance ￼. Well-trained runners typically can sustain vLT2 for ~1 hour (roughly half-marathon race pace) ￼. It follows that workouts at this intensity (continuous tempo runs or longer intervals) are crucial for improving threshold speed and endurance. Indeed, top marathoners regularly include tempo runs of 8–20 km at or near LT pace in training ￼. Casado’s data quantitatively confirm that accumulating distance at threshold pace yields performance benefits ￼, aligning with the broader literature linking threshold training to improvements in aerobic capacity and running economy.

1.3 Contrasting and Refining Evidence (Nuances & Discrepancies)

While the general pattern of “high volume with mostly easy running plus some threshold/interval work” is widely supported, some nuances emerge in the literature. Training intensity distribution (TID) can vary by event specialty and individual, suggesting there is no one-size model for all elites. A 2022 systematic review of elite distance runners found most employ a pyramidal TID (highest volume in zone1 easy, lesser in zone2 threshold, least in zone3 high intensity) during base phases, but some shift toward a more polarized TID (high volume of both low and high intensity, little moderate) in competition phases ￼ ￼. For example, elite marathoners tend to do relatively more threshold training (zone2 tempo work), yielding a pyramidal profile, whereas 1500 m runners do more interval work with less moderate mileage, yielding a polarized profile ￼ ￼. Both approaches produce world-class performances, indicating multiple paths to success within the broader high-volume paradigm. Casado’s finding that long-interval sessions (e.g. 1000 m repeats at 5k pace) were less predictive of success ￼ might seem to downplay high-intensity training. However, this may reflect that athletes naturally limit very intense volume to remain fresh; it does not imply interval training is unimportant. Other studies document that most elites still perform 1–3 high-intensity sessions per week ￼ – often as short intervals (e.g. 200–400 m reps) or hill repeats – to develop VO₂max, speed, and fatigue resistance. Casado’s own title notes “deliberate practice of short-interval and tempo runs” is important ￼, and coaches would agree that quality sessions are needed alongside the heavy diet of easy runs.

An interesting contrast was observed between athletes of different backgrounds. Casado et al. (2020) compared the training of the best Kenyan vs. Spanish runners, and found the Kenyans performed a greater fraction of their training as tempo runs (zone2 threshold work) than the top Spanish runners ￼. Despite both groups being highly successful, this hints that some East African runners emphasize a slightly higher-intensity (though still predominantly aerobic) training style – perhaps reflecting cultural training philosophies or extraordinary base capacity. This could be seen as a refinement of the volume-intensity balance: athletes with extremely high mileage (Kenyans often exceed 180–200 km/week at altitude) can incorporate more threshold work without tipping into overtraining, whereas others might achieve a similar effect with a more strictly polarized approach. The Kenyan approach of “high mileage and high threshold volume” aligns with observations that their easy runs, while classified as ‘easy’, are often at a steady moderate pace approaching marathon effort. In contrast, many European runners keep easy runs truly easy and rely slightly more on interval intensity for stimulus. The commonality, however, remains that total volume and consistency are paramount in both models, confirming Casado’s core finding that overall training volume – especially easy mileage – underpins performance ￼ ￼.

Other studies also add context regarding diminishing returns and individualization. For instance, mid-level competitive runners might see performance plateau or injury risk rise if they simply pile on volume without adequate recovery. While Casado et al. focused on elites, research on recreational runners suggests that after a certain point, smarter intensity distribution yields more gains than extra miles alone ￼ ￼. In short, Casado et al.’s results are well-supported – they confirm decades of coaching lore (“miles make champions”) with data ￼. But the broader literature also indicates that the type of miles (easy vs. moderate vs. hard) should be tuned to the athlete’s event and level. Both polarized (heavy easy + some very hard) and pyramidal (heavy easy + some moderate + a bit of very hard) intensity distributions can yield elite performances ￼ ￼. Casado’s work essentially bridges these: it highlights that easy volume and tempo (threshold) volume were the two biggest factors, implying an approach somewhere between pure polarized and pure threshold model. This synthesis is in line with other peer-reviewed evidence showing high-level runners often blend large easy mileage, regular threshold workouts, and occasional intervals for best results ￼ ￼.

2. Deliberate Practice Theory vs. Polarized Training in Endurance Sports

Deliberate Practice (DP) theory and polarized training represent two frameworks for improving performance, each with distinct emphasis:

2.1 Principles of Deliberate Practice in Endurance Training

Deliberate practice theory, originating from Ericsson’s work on skill acquisition, posits that expertise stems from many hours of highly focused, goal-oriented practice tasks that provide feedback and require substantial mental effort. In the context of endurance sports, DP can be interpreted as targeting training at intensities and skills most relevant to competition, rather than accumulating unstructured volume. Casado et al. explicitly frame tempo runs and interval sessions as “deliberate practice” activities – these are workouts run at or above race pace that athletes rate as highly relevant and mentally demanding ￼ ￼. Such sessions are designed to challenge physiological limiters (e.g. lactate threshold, VO₂max, running economy) and typically require concentration and effort, fitting the DP criteria of being purposeful and effortful practice. For example, a long tempo run at half-marathon pace or repeat 1-km intervals at 5k pace directly push the athlete’s capacities in ways closely tied to race performance. The DP approach would suggest that to improve, an endurance athlete should spend a significant portion of training time on these specific, hard efforts that address known weaknesses or performance determinants (like threshold pace, speed endurance, etc.).

Psychologically, deliberate practice in endurance is characterized by high mental engagement during key workouts. Athletes must focus on pacing, running form, and internal signals (like breathing or muscle fatigue) during these challenging sessions. DP theory holds that this kind of concentrated, feedback-driven practice leads to the greatest adaptations. A DP-oriented training plan might include more frequent race-pace runs, hard intervals, or technical skill drills (for sports like cycling or swimming, for instance) – essentially maximizing the time spent at intensities that directly stimulate improvement. The presumed benefit is specificity: by often training near the edge of one’s comfort zone, the athlete continuously reinforces the exact physiological and neural adaptations needed for their event. Over time, this could elevate the performance ceiling more efficiently than simply accumulating low-intensity volume.

However, in pure form this approach carries downsides for endurance sports. Physiologically, doing too many hard sessions can lead to excessive fatigue, insufficient recovery, and risk overtraining or injury due to the repeated high strain. The body’s adaptive systems (muscle fibers, mitochondria, hormonal axes, etc.) need easy periods to rebuild. Psychologically, a strict DP approach can be draining – continuously pushing oneself in training can reduce enjoyment and increase burnout risk. Most successful endurance coaches therefore temper the deliberate-practice mentality (i.e. “quality over quantity”) with ample low-intensity training to balance stress and recovery.

2.2 Overview of the Polarized Training Model

The polarized training model is an intensity distribution strategy that has been observed in many endurance champions and validated in studies. The term “polarized” refers to training being concentrated at two ends of the intensity spectrum: very easy and very hard, with little in the middle. In practice, a polarized program might have ~75–80% of sessions (or training time) at low intensity (zone 1, easy conversational pace) and ~20–25% at high intensity (zone 3, near VO₂max pace), with only a small fraction at mid-intensity threshold levels ￼ ￼. This approach was first noted anecdotally by coaches and later quantified by scientists like Seiler. For instance, a polarized schedule for a week might include four to five easy runs and two high-intensity interval sessions, deliberately avoiding the moderately hard efforts on easy days. The rationale is to maximize adaptation from both ends: low-intensity work builds aerobic base with minimal stress, and high-intensity work improves maximal capacities – while the lack of “moderate” days ensures adequate recovery and freshness to hit the next hard day with quality.

Physiologically, polarized training plays to how the body responds to different stimuli. Low-intensity, high-volume running stimulates adaptations like increased capillary density, mitochondrial growth, and fat oxidation, all of which improve endurance and efficiency at submaximal efforts. High-intensity interval work, on the other hand, pushes VO₂max, anaerobic capacity, and neuromuscular recruitment. By keeping these stimuli separate (easy days truly easy), an athlete can do the hard workouts at near-max effort, eliciting strong adaptive signals without the accumulating fatigue of daily hard efforts ￼ ￼. This model also leverages the idea that doing a lot of moderate-threshold training might chronically tire an athlete but not be intense enough to significantly boost top-end capacity. Indeed, Seiler and colleagues suggest polarized training yields “maximal adaptive signaling while minimizing stress responses and overtraining risk” ￼. In simple terms, the hard/easy separation allows higher-quality intervals and greater total easy volume, whereas a threshold-heavy approach might leave the athlete in a constantly fatigued middle state.

Psychologically, polarized training can be more sustainable. Easy sessions are genuinely easy (often described as “recovery runs” or long slow distance that one could do daily without feeling burnt out), which can enhance an athlete’s enjoyment and reduce mental fatigue. The hard sessions, while very challenging, are infrequent (perhaps 2 times per week), so athletes can mentally gear up for them, knowing they have recovery after. Many athletes find this polarized rhythm (often described as “hard day, easy day” cycling) to be motivating and lower in monotony: easy days are almost like active recovery, and hard days provide variety and a sense of accomplishment. Over a season, this can help maintain morale and consistency. By contrast, a DP or threshold-heavy program might make every workout feel demanding, increasing the risk of staleness.

2.3 Physiological Differences and Adaptations

The DP-focused (quality-intensive) approach and the polarized model can lead to somewhat different physiological profiles. A deliberate practice (threshold-emphasized) program will spend more time in the middle zone (lactate threshold region). This is very effective for raising the lactate threshold itself – i.e., increasing the speed or power one can sustain for ~1 hour. It also can improve running economy at moderately high speeds and increase tolerance to sustained lactate levels. Athletes who train a lot at threshold often show excellent fractional utilization of VO₂max (they can hold a high percentage of their VO₂max for long durations) ￼. For example, Norwegian training methods for mid-distance runners (often double threshold workouts in a day) aim to heavily stimulate these adaptations. The trade-off is that training in this zone still produces significant stress and glycogen depletion, so doing it too often can limit recovery.

Polarized training, with its emphasis on low-intensity volume, might produce superior adaptations in terms of fat metabolism and oxidative capacity due to large amounts of time-on-feet at aerobic intensities. This enhances the ability to utilize fat for fuel and spares glycogen, critical for marathoners and ultra-runners. Additionally, polarized plans put a premium on VO₂max and speed development via high-intensity intervals. Intervals at 90–100+% VO₂max stress the cardiovascular system maximally and can improve stroke volume and oxygen uptake kinetics. Over time, polarized-trained athletes often reach very high VO₂max values and robust aerobic bases. On the flip side, if an athlete does very little threshold training, they might not be quite as efficient at clearing lactate or running at that “comfortably hard” pace for long durations. However, many polarized models are not zero threshold; they just limit it. (Notably, some describe elite TID as more “pyramidal” than strictly polarized – meaning there is still a substantial, if smaller, amount of threshold work ￼.)

An important physiological consideration is that individual response varies. Some athletes respond extremely well to heavy doses of threshold training (improving rapidly in aerobic metrics), while others thrive on polarized training and get stale with too much threshold. For instance, highly trained athletes with many years of base may benefit from a greater proportion of moderate/hard sessions (DP style) to continue improving specific fitness. Conversely, less trained individuals often make big gains just by increasing low-intensity volume and a little high intensity (more polarized), because their base is underdeveloped. The polarized model’s success across numerous studies suggests it hits a sweet spot for many: it provides enough high-intensity to spur improvement, but not so much that the athlete can’t accumulate a high aerobic volume ￼ ￼. Threshold-centric training might accelerate gains in the short term (by concentrating on the most race-specific intensity), but without sufficient low-intensity support, it could plateau or cause stress-related stagnation.

2.4 Psychological and Logistical Differences

From a psychological standpoint, the two approaches can feel quite different in daily practice. A DP or threshold-model program may have more days of medium-hard workouts. This can create a sense of constant pressure on the athlete – every key run demands focus and pushes discomfort. Some athletes enjoy the challenge, finding that frequent hard efforts keep them sharp and confident at race pace. They might also derive motivation from seeing metrics improve in these workouts. However, others might experience mental fatigue or anxiety, as there are fewer truly “relaxed” days. Motivation can dip if the athlete is not adequately recovering or if workouts start to go poorly due to cumulative fatigue.

Polarized training, with its clear separation of hard and easy days, often yields a better psychological balance. Easy days serve as mental breathers – the athlete can run for enjoyment or social reasons without worrying about hitting splits. This can maintain a love for training. Meanwhile, hard days, though brutal, are limited in number, allowing an athlete to mentally compartmentalize stress. Many coaches report that athletes on a polarized or hard/easy scheme exhibit higher training consistency because they avoid the grey zone that often leads to burnout. It’s easier to tell an athlete “run really slow today” and have them comply if they understand a gut-busting interval session awaits tomorrow (and vice versa). In essence, polarized training may improve an athlete’s recovery and anticipation cycle – they recover mentally and physically on easy days and then look forward to testing themselves on hard days, which can enhance engagement and long-term adherence.

Another difference is monitoring and feedback. A DP-theory approach that emphasizes deliberate practice might involve meticulous tracking of performance in key workouts, video analysis, technique feedback, etc., since DP is about mindful improvement. For example, an athlete might review lactate readings in each threshold session or carefully note splits and how they felt, treating each such run as a test of progress. Polarized training can be monitored more simply by ensuring the athlete’s heart rate or pace stays low on easy days and that they reach target zones on hard days – it’s more about maintaining the intensity distribution than scrutinizing every moderate workout (since there are few). This isn’t to say polarized lacks feedback – interval sessions still provide performance data – but the approach might be considered more intuitive or “big picture,” whereas a DP-heavy approach can be detail-oriented (since every moderate session is a chance to measure improvement).

2.5 When Each Model is Most Appropriate

In practice, coaches often blend these models, but certain contexts favor one over the other:
	•	Event Specialty: As noted, longer events (half-marathon, marathon) often necessitate more threshold training. Marathoners benefit from extensive practice at marathon pace (which is ~LT1/LT2 border) to build fuel efficiency and muscular endurance. A strict polarized model (with almost no tempo running) might leave a marathoner under-prepared for the specific demands of holding a strong steady pace for 2+ hours. Thus, a pyramidal model (a moderate amount of zone2 tempo work) can be more appropriate for marathoners ￼. In contrast, for a 800 m or 1500 m runner, where races are very high-intensity, a polarized or even “overloading” model of lots of easy + a good volume of very fast intervals might yield the best results ￼. Indeed, coaches of elite milers often limit threshold running in-season to ensure freshness for interval training and anaerobic development. In short: shorter, more anaerobic events lean polarized; longer, purely aerobic events incorporate more deliberate threshold work.
	•	Athlete’s Experience Level: Novice or amateur runners typically have low training volumes and struggle to handle many intense days. For them, a polarized (or 80/20-style) approach is usually safest and most effective. The priority is to build an aerobic base and skeletal-muscular durability through easy mileage. Too much “deliberate practice” intensity for a novice often leads to injury or burnout. They simply lack the foundation to benefit from frequent threshold work. Additionally, amateurs often unconsciously do a lot of medium-hard running (because they lack pacing discipline), which puts them in a perpetual fatigue state. Adopting a polarized mindset (“easy means easy”) can correct that tendency and improve their consistency. On the other hand, elite athletes with years of base training can often incorporate more frequent intense sessions (essentially applying DP theory in doses) because their bodies are conditioned to handle it. For example, some elite programs use double-threshold workouts twice a week (a morning tempo and afternoon tempo on the same day, as seen in Norwegian training models) – something impossible for an amateur. Thus, deliberate practice elements (highly focused interval/threshold training) constitute a larger fraction of an elite’s program relative to a beginner’s, though even elites generally keep these to ~2–3 days a week, not every day ￼.
	•	Training Phase: Periodization is key. During base phases, a more polarized or pyramidal approach (high easy volume, low race-specific work) is commonly used to establish aerobic fitness and allow a lot of low-stress mileage. As competition nears, training often shifts towards more specific intensity – essentially increasing deliberate practice elements (e.g., more race-pace workouts, sharpening intervals) ￼. Coaches often intuitively follow this blend: early phase polarized (to build capacity with low fatigue), later phase threshold and race-pace focus (to translate capacity into performance). This dynamic use of both models is endorsed by many world-class coaches who plan a “transition from pyramidal in preparatory period to polarized in competitive period” ￼ – effectively using threshold work in build-up, then focusing on high-intensity sharpening and recovery in-season.
	•	Physiological/psychological profile of the athlete: Some athletes are “high responders” to volume – they improve dramatically by simply adding easy miles (these athletes thrive on polarized or high-volume pyramidal plans). Others are “high responders” to intensity – they need a heavy stimulus of fast running to make breakthroughs (these might do better with more DP-style training). Also, an athlete who enjoys hard training and can mentally handle it might lean into a threshold-heavy plan, whereas an athlete who tends to get mentally overwhelmed might do better with polarized to keep hard days limited. Motivation and life stress play a role too: a recreational runner with limited time might find it more practical to include moderate/hard efforts in most runs (a bit of DP theory) to maximize the use of 5 hours/week. In contrast, a professional with 12 hours/week can afford to do 8 hours easy and 4 hours quality (polarized/pyramidal) and still hit high absolute training stimulus.

In summary, deliberate practice theory and polarized training are not mutually exclusive; they are lenses through which to view training. Deliberate practice reminds us that quality, specific efforts are necessary to reach peak performance – you must train with intent and spend time at the intensities that matter for your race. Polarized training reminds us that the distribution of intensities must be managed – you cannot perform at a high level if you try to make every day hard. The best endurance programs use a combination: a large amount of easy running (providing the endurance base and recovery) and a handful of well-designed, deliberate harder sessions each week. This combined approach has been validated by both science and practice. It’s noteworthy that this balance is reflected in recent debates in sports science: in 2022, Foster, Seiler, Casado, and colleagues argued in favor of polarized training as the optimal model for endurance development ￼, while Burnley, Bearden, and Jones counter-argued that a polarized approach is not universally optimal, suggesting the need for more threshold-focused work in some scenarios ￼. The reality is likely in between – most successful athletes operate in a broad pyramidal zone (lots of easy, some threshold, some high intensity) and adjust according to their individual response and event. The polarized vs. threshold debate has essentially pushed coaches to find the sweet spot for each athlete rather than adhere dogmatically to one philosophy.

3. Evidence-Based Training Distribution Guidelines

Research findings can be translated into practical guidelines on training intensity distribution (TID) and volume for runners of different levels. Below is a summary of recommended training distribution for elite, sub-elite, and amateur long-distance runners, based on evidence from the literature:

Table 1. Approximate Training Intensity Distribution Guidelines (by percent of total running volume or time)

Runner Level	Weekly Volume (approx)	~% Easy (Low Intensity)	~% Tempo/Threshold (Moderate Intensity)	~% Interval/Rep (High Intensity)	Typical Weekly Structure (Examples)
Elite (international caliber)	140–180+ km (high mileage) ￼	~75–85% in zone 1 (easy aerobic) ￼	~10–15% in zone 2 (threshold/tempo) ￼	~5–10% in zone 3 (VO₂max intervals) ￼	~2 hard workouts/week (e.g. one tempo run ~tempo pace, one interval/hill session) + high easy mileage (often twice-daily runs)
Sub-elite (national/regional)	80–130 km (moderate-high volume)	~75–80% easy aerobic	~15–20% threshold (tempo/steady runs)	~5–10% high intensity	~2 quality sessions/week (one longer tempo or progression run; one interval session). Easy runs dominate other days, but overall volume slightly less than elites.
Amateur (competitive recreational)	30–70 km (lower volume)	~80% easy runs (conversational pace) ￼	~15% moderate (tempo or pace runs)	~5% high (speed work)	1–2 quality days/week (e.g. one interval or fartlek, plus occasional tempo run). Most runs very easy to build base and avoid injury; intensity is limited but still present for development.

Elite runners: The literature and real-world data suggest elites benefit from maintaining around 80% of running at low intensity (zone 1), with the remaining ~20% split between threshold and high-intensity work ￼. Many elite marathoners follow a pyramidal model – for example, a weekly schedule might include one sustained tempo run (~20–40 min at lactate threshold pace) and one interval session (such as 10×400 m or 5×1000 m at 3k-5k pace), with all other runs being easy or steady recovery runs. This often translates to ~2 “hard” sessions out of 12+ runs per week. Marathoners and half-marathoners lean toward a bit more tempo volume (upper end of that 15% moderate range) to specifically prepare for their race pace ￼. For instance, an elite marathoner might do a mid-week 15 km run at marathon pace (moderate intensity) in addition to a shorter threshold run. Milers/5k runners might skew the 20% more toward interval intensity and slightly less tempo (more polarized) ￼. Overall, the guideline for elites is often cited as an “80/20 rule” (or 75/20/5 in three-zone terms) as a starting point ￼, which is supported by Casado et al.’s finding that easy and tempo training volumes were the top predictors of performance ￼. High mileage is a hallmark – world-class athletes run double sessions on most days to accumulate distance while still keeping each run’s stress manageable.

Sub-elite runners: This group (e.g. very good club runners, collegiate athletes, emerging elites) often trains similarly to elites in terms of distribution, but with adjusted volume. A sub-elite might handle 80–120 km per week, still aiming for roughly 75–80% easy mileage. Studies show that even at this level, those who polarize or pyramidal-ize their training tend to outperform those who do too much moderate work ￼ ￼. So a sub-elite 10k runner might do, say, one interval workout (e.g. 5×1000 m), one threshold run (20 min at tempo pace or a 10k-pace interval session), and the rest easy. Because their total volume is a bit lower, the percentage of moderate/high might creep slightly higher (they might spend relatively more time at threshold since they run fewer total hours). For example, 15% of 100 km is 15 km at threshold pace – a sub-elite might indeed do ~15 km of tempo in a week (like a 10 km tempo run plus some tempo within a long run). The key is that even at sub-elite level, easy running is the majority. Coaches emphasize not falling into the trap of doing all runs “moderately hard.” Instead, sub-elites are advised to mimic elite practices scaled to their capacity: maintain recovery days and long aerobic runs, and insert a couple of hard stimuli weekly. This approach is evidence-based: in studies, well-trained runners using a pyramidal 3-zone distribution (lots of zone1, some zone2, few zone3) improved more than those using threshold-heavy plans ￼. Sub-elites also should periodize intensity – perhaps doing more threshold training in base phase to raise aerobic ceiling, then more interval training in pre-competition, similar to elites.

Amateur runners: Competitive recreational runners (e.g. those targeting a first marathon or aiming to break a personal best with limited training time) benefit greatly from a simple rule: “slow down on easy days, don’t race your training.” Often, amateurs inadvertently train in zone 2 (moderate) on most days, which leaves them fatigued but not optimally adapted. Adopting an ~80/20 distribution can yield quick improvements ￼ ￼. For instance, an amateur running 50 km per week could ensure ~40 km of that are truly easy (comfortable enough to chat or strictly below ~75% HRmax), and allocate ~10 km to harder efforts (e.g. an interval workout that totals 6 km of fast running and a 4 km tempo run in the week). Research in recreational runners by Muñoz et al. and others indicates that polarized or 80/20 training produces better 5k/10k performance gains than a threshold-heavy approach, without additional injury risk ￼ ￼. In one study, a 9-week polarized program (77% low, 3% moderate, 20% high) improved both VO₂max and 2 km time trial performance significantly, with no losses in VO₂max or signs of overtraining – and results were on par with a threshold-focused group ￼ ￼. The takeaway for amateurs is to prioritize consistency and aerobic base: an easy-to-hard ratio of roughly 4:1 is a sound starting point. Typically, one might include one high-intensity session per week (e.g. interval repeats, fartlek, or hill reps) and one threshold or tempo run (perhaps a parkrun or steady 20-minute tempo). All other runs (including the weekly long run) should be kept easy enough to recover and build volume. By doing this, amateurs can maximize gains from limited mileage – the easy runs build durability and capillary networks, while the hard runs provide sufficient stimulus for improvement in speed and aerobic capacity. This evidence-based practice helps avoid the common mistake of the “moderate-intensity rut” (sometimes called the “gray zone”), where an amateur’s every run is a bit too fast to be easy and too slow to be a true workout, yielding suboptimal progress.

It’s important to note that these percentages are guidelines, not rigid rules. Individual tuning is required: Some amateurs with very low volume (e.g. 20 km/week) might benefit from a higher percentage of intense work (because 80% of 20 km is only 16 km easy, which might not induce much adaptation – they might do, say, 70% easy, 30% hard split, equating to two quality days). Conversely, an older runner might handle only one hard day, making their distribution more like 90% easy, 10% hard. Still, the overarching principle from the evidence is clear: for all levels, a large proportion of training should be easy aerobic running, supplemented by regular but judicious doses of threshold and interval training ￼ ￼. This principle scales by level – elites simply do it on a bigger volume and can handle slightly more frequent intensity.

4. Limitations of Casado et al. (2021) and Methodological Considerations

While Casado et al.’s study provides valuable insights, several limitations in their methodology should be recognized:
	•	Retrospective Self-Reported Data: The study relied on athletes recalling their training patterns over 3, 5, and 7-year periods. Such retrospective questionnaires are prone to recall bias and inaccuracies – even highly motivated athletes may misremember details of weekly training from years past. As one expert critique noted, “asking people to retrospectively recall highly-specific and date-sensitive info over a 7-year period is ridiculous” ￼. Fortunately, 72% of the subjects did use training logs to aid their recall ￼, but we cannot be certain of the detail or accuracy of those logs. Memory limitations might especially affect the exact volumes of each run type, potentially blurring differences. This limitation means the results should be taken as showing broad associations rather than precise causation. A prospective design (tracking training in real-time) would yield stronger data. Indeed, with modern GPS and online training platforms, future studies can and should capture detailed training metrics prospectively to verify these findings ￼.
	•	Use of IAAF Scoring Tables for Performance: Converting performance to a point score enabled comparison across events (e.g., 5k vs marathon). This is a common approach, but it has assumptions. The IAAF (World Athletics) tables attempt to equate performances, but some argue they may undervalue or overvalue certain events (for instance, comparing a 1500 m time to a marathon time on points isn’t perfect science). Additionally, a single best performance may not fully represent an athlete’s capabilities or consistency. However, in the context of this study – focusing on “world-class performances” – the scoring system likely served its purpose of standardizing “performance” as a dependent variable. A related point is that the study did not differentiate whether an athlete specialized in one event; training optimized for a marathon vs. 5k might look different, yet all were pooled together in analysis after converting to points. This could mask event-specific training effects. An elite 5000 m runner, for example, might do relatively more interval work (since their event is shorter) and still achieve a high IAAF score; if lumped with marathoners, it might appear they did “less optimal” training by Casado’s criteria (since Casado saw less correlation with intervals overall). In short: the performance metric was convenient, but might not capture nuances of specialization.
	•	Lack of Objective Intensity or Load Measurements: Casado et al. categorized training by type (easy run, tempo run, short interval, long interval) and used distance run in each category as the metric. This approach overlooks internal load – how hard those runs were for each athlete. Two athletes might log 100 km of “easy runs” in a period, but one might have done them truly easy (low heart rate) while another ran them somewhat faster (higher heart rate). The study would count both as 100 km of easy running, yet the training stress and adaptation could differ. Without physiological measures like heart rate, pace relative to threshold, or session RPE, it’s hard to ensure all “easy runs” were equivalent in effort. Additionally, using distance as the volume metric can be misleading – a faster athlete covers more kilometers in an hour than a slower athlete. Typically, training load is better captured by time in zone or by weighted metrics like TRIMP (Training Impulse) that account for intensity. The absence of measures like TRIMP, heart-rate zone distribution, or even lactate measurements means the study couldn’t analyze training intensity distribution in a nuanced way (e.g., what % of time was truly below LT1, etc.). It’s possible that some of what they labeled “tempo” vs “easy” might overlap in intensity between athletes. Including metrics such as heart rate zones or GPS pace data would improve reliability – for example, ensuring that “easy” corresponds to <75% HRmax for all athletes, or that “tempo” corresponds to ~90% HRmax. Expert commentators have noted this gap: the study provided no physiological descriptors of the subjects (VO₂max, lactate threshold values, etc.) ￼, which could have contextualized how hard their training really was relative to their capacity.
	•	No Direct Measure of Training Load or Density: Relatedly, the study did not quantify how training was distributed in time (e.g., how many sessions per week, whether workouts were doubled up). Two athletes might both report 20 km of tempo running in a typical week, but one might do it all in one big session, another spread across two sessions – that could impact recovery differently. The retrospective questionnaire probably didn’t capture micro-cycle structure beyond “typical week before competition”. This limits insights into how training was periodized or balanced day-to-day (the study’s scope was not periodization, but it’s a limitation for applying the results).
	•	Simplistic Statistical Approach for Complex Data: The authors used simple correlations and then multiple regression. One critique pointed out that interpreting the simple Pearson correlations in isolation is tricky because the training variables are interrelated (collinear) ￼ ￼. For example, total volume and easy volume are inherently linked – an athlete with very high total volume almost certainly has high easy volume (since most of their running is easy). The high correlation of total distance (r ≥ 0.75) with performance ￼could overshadow other effects. The multiple regression aimed to tease out unique contributions, and it found easy and tempo runs significant ￼. However, it’s not fully clear how the regression model was constructed (the “four models” alluded to in the paper are not described in the abstract). The critique notes we weren’t told how those models were generated ￼. It’s possible the model building was stepwise, which can be prone to bias. In essence, the statistics approach – while appropriate for exploratory analysis – cannot conclusively establish causation. A better design might be longitudinal: e.g., tracking how changes in an athlete’s training mix year to year correlate with changes in performance, to strengthen causal inference.
	•	Sample Characteristics: The study’s sample (85 male runners, some world-class, some elite-standard) is impressive, but it is exclusively male and covers a broad age range (18 to 43) ￼. It did not include women, who might have different training responses or practices (for instance, some evidence suggests females might handle slightly more moderate intensity or need different recovery patterns). Also, the range of talent (national elite up to world record holder) is wide; while they attempted to examine “best performances” after x years, individual talent and genetic potential play a big role in performance. Training is only one piece of the puzzle – the study could not control for genetic VO₂max ceiling, injury history, etc. It’s likely the highest performers had both optimal training and favorable genetics. So, while the training factors explained 57% of performance variance ￼, the unexplained 43% includes those other factors.
	•	No Injury or Stress Monitoring: The study doesn’t report anything about injury rates or how athletes’ health fared with different training volumes. It’s possible that some who attempted very high volumes or lots of intensity got injured and thus didn’t achieve the best performances, removing them from the top cohort. This kind of survivorship bias could influence results – e.g., the ones who ended up world-class were the ones who could handle lots of easy miles plus quality. So the findings might implicitly highlight what works for those with strong durability, whereas a less durable athlete might need a different training recipe. Future studies linking training distribution with injury and illness data would be valuable to temper “do a ton of easy running” with appropriate caution.
	•	Expert Critiques: The analysis by Solomon and Laye (2021) encapsulated several of the above points. They rated the study’s scientific merit as moderate (5/10) ￼. Besides the recall and stats issues, they remarked that the findings, while not novel, “confirm what we have learned from other studies and what endurance coaches observe – that a bigger volume of ‘easy’ is associated with better performance” ￼. In application, they caution that retrospective evidence is a weak level of proof and advocate for leveraging modern data collection for stronger evidence ￼. No formal published rebuttals to Casado et al. (2021) appear in the literature, but the 2022 debate on polarized training suggests some experts might argue that Casado’s interpretation underplays the role of high-intensity training. For instance, Burnley et al. (2022) might say that focusing only on volume and threshold overlooks that many athletes need very hard interval stimuli to reach top form ￼. However, since Casado et al. did acknowledge intervals as important (even if not the top predictor), there isn’t a direct contradiction – it’s more about emphasis. Essentially, the expert consensus is that Casado’s findings are directionally right but need to be applied with nuance.
	•	Alternative Metrics for Reliable Insight: If one were to improve on Casado’s methodology, using metrics like TRIMP (Training Impulse) or cumulative time in HR zones could be very beneficial. TRIMP combines duration and intensity (using heart rate or lactate weighting) to quantify training load. Two athletes with the same distance might have different TRIMPs if one ran that distance harder. By looking at TRIMP, researchers could see if perhaps “training load from tempo runs” correlates even better with performance than simply distance of tempo runs. Moreover, measuring training in terms of minutes in zones (zone1, zone2, zone3 as per physiological thresholds) would allow consistency across athletes. For example, instead of “distance of tempo runs,” one could use “minutes at 90–95% HRmax” as a measure of threshold training dose. This might be more directly tied to physiological adaptation. Using lactate threshold (LT) or critical speed as a reference, one could classify training sessions by intensity relative to LT – providing a personalized view of “easy” vs “hard.” Additionally, integrating measures of internal load like session RPE (how hard the athlete felt the workout was on a 0-10 scale) could account for psychological stress of training.

Including performance-related lab measures would also strengthen insights. If VO₂max, vLT, running economy, etc., were tracked alongside, one could see if, say, those who did more tempo improved their vLT more, which in turn led to better race performance. Casado et al. lacked that intermediate data. Other studies (e.g., Tjelta 2019 on Norwegian 1500m champions ￼) have shown that certain physiological factors (like a high %VO₂max at LT, or high running economy) are crucial – and those factors are trainable via specific means. So, a richer dataset could connect training -> physiological change -> performance, giving more reliable insight than straight training -> performance correlation.

In conclusion, Casado et al. (2021) offered valuable quantitative support for the importance of easy volume and tempo work, but the retrospective and aggregate nature of the data mean we should be cautious in drawing firm conclusions about causation or the “optimal” mix. The study’s limitations highlight a need for more granular, prospective research. Ideally, future studies would monitor a cohort of athletes over several seasons with detailed training logs (including intensity distribution via HR/GPS), measure their physiological metrics periodically, and analyze relationships with performance and health outcomes. Such data could confirm or refine Casado’s findings – for example, determining if time at <LT1 (low intensity) or time at >90% VO₂max (high intensity) is an even better predictor of race success than simply kilometers of “easy” or “tempo.” For now, coaches and athletes can take Casado’s results as evidence reinforcing a balanced program: plenty of easy running to build endurance, regular threshold runs to boost aerobic power, and some intervals to sharpen speed. This aligns well with the consensus of sports science, even as we acknowledge that individual training adjustments will always be necessary. Ultimately, the art of coaching is to apply these evidence-based principles while considering an athlete’s unique context – a principle supported, not contradicted, by Casado et al.’s work ￼.
