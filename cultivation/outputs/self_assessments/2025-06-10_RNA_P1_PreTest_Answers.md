**Legend:**
- **Mastery:** High confidence, correct answer
- **Blind spot:** High confidence, incorrect answer (priority for review)
- **Known gap:** Low/Medium confidence, incorrect answer (self-aware gap)
- **Underconfident correct:** Low/Medium confidence, correct answer (reinforce)
- **Solid:** Medium confidence, correct answer (review to boost confidence)

#### Personalized Recommendations
- **Highest Priority:** Review and deeply study the “blind spot” questions (9, 26, 28, 29). These are areas where your intuition is misaligned with the facts.
- **Next Priority:** Review the “known gaps” for clarity and confidence.
- **Reinforce:** Practice or review the “underconfident corrects” to turn partial knowledge into mastery.
- **Track Progress:** As you continue, aim for more “High x” + correct, and fewer blind spots.
