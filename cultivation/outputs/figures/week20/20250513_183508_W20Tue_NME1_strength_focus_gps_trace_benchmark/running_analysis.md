TASK
----
1. **Analyze the Pre-Run Wellness Context section** (as shown below) in detail. For each metric, comment on its value, trend (Δ1d, Δ7d), and any notable deviations, improvements, or risks. Consider how these wellness factors might impact the athlete's readiness, performance, and recovery for this session. If multiple data sources are present (e.g., Whoop vs Garmin RHR), compare and interpret both. Highlight any discrepancies or patterns that could inform training decisions.

--- Pre-Run Wellness Context (Data for 2025-05-13, from `run_summary.txt`) ---
   HRV (Whoop): 115.0 ms (Δ1d: n/a, Δ7d: +23.2%)
   RHR (Whoop): 53.0 bpm (Δ1d: n/a, Δ7d: -5.4%)
   RHR (Garmin): 48.0 bpm (Δ1d: -5.9%, Δ7d: -7.7%)
   Recovery Score (Whoop): 91.0 % (Δ1d: n/a, Δ7d: +75.0%)
   Sleep Score (Whoop): 77.0 % (Δ1d: n/a, Δ7d: -7.2%)
   Body Battery (Garmin): 55.2 % (Δ1d: +133.5%, Δ7d: -1.7%) *Initial value, likely updated by day end*
   Avg Stress (Garmin, Prev Day): n/a
   Sleep Duration (Whoop): 11.7 h (Δ1d: n/a, Δ7d: +34.9%)
   Sleep Consistency (Whoop): 28.0 % (Δ1d: n/a, Δ7d: -51.7%)
   Sleep Disturbances/hr (Whoop): 0.5  (Δ1d: n/a, Δ7d: +14.1%)
   Strain Score (Whoop): 15.3  (Δ1d: n/a, Δ7d: +93.9%)
   Skin Temp (Whoop): 92.1 °F (Δ1d: n/a, Δ7d: +180.9%) *This large jump is unusual, needs monitoring; likely a misreading or calibration issue.*
   Resp Rate (Whoop): 16.6 rpm (Δ1d: n/a, Δ7d: +0.0%)
   Steps (Garmin): 8137.0  (Δ1d: +300%+, Δ7d: +300%+) *Likely reflects activity up to the point of GPX recording start*
   Total Activity (Garmin): 146.6 min (Δ1d: +155.7%, Δ7d: +300%+) *As above*
   Resp Rate (Garmin): 14.7 rpm (Δ1d: +3.8%, Δ7d: +6.6%)
   VO2max (Garmin): n/a
   ---
   **Interpretation of Pre-Run Wellness Context:**
    *   **Overall Readiness:** Appears generally good to excellent from a physiological recovery standpoint, justifying a "Green" or high "Amber" light. The inferred "💛 Amber" in `session_notes` is a reasonable self-assessment, likely factoring in the poor sleep consistency or subjective feel.
    *   **HRV (Whoop):** 115.0 ms is a strong value, and the 7-day trend (+23.2%) is positive, indicating good adaptation and recovery.
    *   **RHR (Whoop & Garmin):** Both Whoop (53 bpm) and Garmin (48 bpm) RHR are low and show favorable 7-day downward trends. Garmin RHR is consistently lower. This suggests good cardiovascular recovery.
    *   **Recovery Score (Whoop):** 91.0% is excellent, with a significant 7-day improvement.
    *   **Sleep Score (Whoop):** 77.0% is decent, though slightly down over 7 days.
    *   **Sleep Duration (Whoop):** 11.7h is exceptionally long and significantly up over 7 days. This could be "catch-up" sleep, which is beneficial.
    *   **Sleep Consistency (Whoop):** 28.0% is very poor and a major negative flag (-51.7% Δ7d). This indicates highly irregular sleep timing, which can disrupt circadian rhythms and negatively impact alertness, hormonal balance, and perceived exertion, even if total duration is high. This is likely the primary driver for an "Amber" self-assessment.
    *   **Body Battery (Garmin):** 55.2% is moderate. The significant Δ1d increase suggests it was very low the previous day.
    *   **Strain Score (Whoop):** 15.3 is a high daily strain, up significantly Δ7d. This reflects a demanding previous day or week.
    *   **Skin Temp (Whoop):** The +180.9% Δ7d to 92.1 °F is a major anomaly and likely a data error or sensor issue. Needs careful monitoring; a true temperature change of this magnitude would indicate illness.
    *   **Risks/Impact:** The primary risk factor is poor sleep consistency, which can mask underlying fatigue or reduce tolerance to new stressors (like this neuromuscular session). The high prior day strain also suggests caution. The heat (26.5°C at start) would add to the physiological challenge. The anomalous skin temp reading should be investigated.

2. Continue with the standard audit: compare planned vs. actual, surface key metrics, inconsistencies, and actionable steps as usual.

3. Extract **planned workout targets** from `cultivation/outputs/training_plans/baseox_daily_plans/week20/GOAL.md` and `cultivation/outputs/training_plans/baseox_daily_plans/week20/Week20_Tue_2025-05-13_ECONOMY_DEV_1.md`:
    *   **Session Type:** Neuromuscular & Economy Development 1 (Strength Focus)
    *   **Overall Duration:** 45-60 min
    *   **Components & Targets:**
        *   Dynamic Warm-up: 10 min
        *   Running Drills (A-Skips, B-Skips, High Knees, Butt Kicks): 2 sets x 20-30m each. Quality focus.
        *   Plyometrics (Introductory - Low Impact & Form): Ankle Hops (2x10-12), Pogo Jumps (2x10-12), Low Box Step-offs/Jumps (2x5-8/leg, focus soft landing, step down), Standing Broad Jumps (2x3-5, stick landing).
        *   Calisthenics Strength (Push Day emphasis): Select 3-4 key exercises from plan (Incline Push-ups, Dips, Pike Push-ups, Plank, Pseudo Planche Lean), 2-3 sets each, ~20-25 min.
        *   Cool-down: 5-10 min.
    *   **No planned continuous run, HR, pace, or specific running cadence targets.** The GPS trace captures the entire outdoor activity.

4. Load **zone definitions**:
    *   Primary: Parsed `cultivation/data/zones_personal.yml`.
        *   From `advanced_metrics.txt`, zones are:
            *   Z1 (Recovery): {'bpm': [0, 145], 'pace_min_per_km': [7.0, 999]}
            *   Z2 (Aerobic): {'bpm': [145, 160], 'pace_min_per_km': [6.85, 8.7]}
            *   Z3 (Tempo): {'bpm': [161, 175], 'pace_min_per_km': [5.2, 6.85]}
            *   Z4 (Threshold): {'bpm': [176, 186], 'pace_min_per_km': [4.8, 5.2]}
            *   Z5 (VO2max): {'bpm': [187, 201], 'pace_min_per_km': [0.0, 4.8]}
        *   Assuming HRmax = 201 bpm based on Z5 upper limit.
    *   Cross-verification with `cultivation/outputs/training_plans/pace-zones.md`:
        *   The `pace-zones.md` file indicates "AeT-Anchored Scheme (CURRENT)" with Z2 ceiling 160bpm. HR Zones: Z1 (0-145), Z2 (145-160), Z3 (161-175), Z4 (176-186), Z5 (187-201).
        *   ✅ The zones match. No discrepancy.

🏃‍♂️:

**0 · TL;DR**
This session was a "Neuromuscular & Economy Development 1 (Strength Focus)" benchmark, executed under Amber readiness (poor sleep consistency) and warm conditions (26.5°C+). The athlete adapted the plan due to equipment and fatigue, notably reducing calisthenics volume and substituting a plyo exercise. A significant HR spike (176bpm) post-plyometrics and high RPEs (UB 8.5, LB 7.5) indicate a challenging but likely effective neuromuscular stimulus.

**2 · Root-Cause / Consistency Notes**
*   **Misleading "Run" Metrics:** The auto-detected 0.86km "run segment" and its associated metrics (EF, Decoupling, HR Drift) are not representative of a planned running effort and have limited value for assessing aerobic performance in this mixed-modal session. They likely capture a period of more continuous movement during drills.
*   **Temperature Discrepancy:** `session_notes` mentions ~31°C, `weather.txt` reports 26.5°C. Both indicate warm conditions impacting RPE and HR. The 26.5°C is likely from a weather API at GPX start; session could have been in hotter microclimate or "feels like" was higher.
*   **Broad Jump Volume:** Actual 2x8 reps vs. planned 2x3-5 reps. This is a significant increase for an explosive exercise and likely contributed to quad fatigue and the high HR spike.
*   **Session Notes Crucial:** The `session_notes...benchmark.md` is essential for understanding the actual execution, RPEs, and deviations, far more than the automated running TXT files for this type of session.

**3 · Target vs Actual**
*   **Session Intent:** To benchmark neuromuscular and foundational strength elements. This was largely achieved despite modifications.
    *   **Planned:** Drills, Plyos (low impact intro), Calisthenics (Push focus, 3-4 exercises, 2-3 sets).
    *   **Actual:**
        *   Drills: Completed as planned, RPE 6-7.
        *   Plyos: Ankle/Pogo Hops as planned. Low Box Jumps subbed with Tuck Jumps (2x5, no box). Broad Jumps increased to 2x8 reps (planned 2x3-5). **High HR spike (176bpm) and quad burn noted post-plyos.**
        *   Calisthenics: Significantly reduced to 1 set each: Knee Push-ups (1x9, no incline), Pike Push-ups (1x5), Dips (1x2, failure), Plank (1x50s). Pseudo Planche Lean omitted. This was a sensible autoregulation due to high RPE (UB 8.5, LB 7.5) and early failure on dips.
*   **Highlights:**
    *   Successful execution of drills and most plyometrics with good adaptation (Tuck Jump sub).
    *   High effort and RPEs indicate a strong neuromuscular stimulus.
    *   Autoregulation in calisthenics to prioritize quality over volume when fatigued was appropriate.
    *   Detailed session logging in `session_notes` provides excellent qualitative data.
*   **Limiters:**
    *   **Readiness:** Poor sleep consistency and high prior day strain likely reduced work capacity.
    *   **Heat:** 26.5°C+ conditions increased physiological strain.
    *   **Equipment:** Lack of incline and box necessitated exercise substitutions.
    *   **Fatigue:** Cumulative fatigue led to early failure in dips and reduced calisthenics volume. The increased Broad Jump volume may have exacerbated this.
    *   **Logistics:** Time lost to finding a suitable location.
*   **Environmental Analysis:** Warm (26.5°C), clear sky. Heat was a significant factor, noted in `session_notes` ("HR spike...compounded by heat").

**4 · Action Plan**
1.  **Refine "Run" Detection for Mixed Sessions:** For sessions tagged as "Strength" or "Mixed-Modal" (future system enhancement), suppress or heavily contextualize automated run metrics (EF, Decoupling, Drift) if detected segments are very short and intermittent.
2.  **Clarify Broad Jump Volume:** For future NME1 sessions, adhere to the planned 2x3-5 reps for Broad Jumps unless a specific reason for increase is documented. Evaluate if 2x8 contributed excessively to fatigue.
3.  **Plyometric Recovery:** Implement the `session_notes` recommendation: 90-120s active recovery (walk, breathing) between *each plyometric exercise variation*, not just sets, especially in heat.
4.  **Heat Protocol:** Reinforce pre-hydration, electrolyte use, and session timing for cooler periods for NME sessions.
5.  **Equipment Preparation:** Ensure necessary equipment (incline surface, low box) is available or plan substitutions in advance to match planned stimulus more closely.
6.  **Investigate Skin Temp Anomaly:** Monitor Whoop skin temperature readings for ongoing anomalies.
7.  **Improve Sleep Consistency:** Prioritize strategies to improve sleep timing regularity.

This session served as a valuable benchmark for neuromuscular and strength work. The key is to integrate the qualitative data from session notes with the quantitative GPS trace, recognizing the limitations of applying pure running analytics to such a mixed-modal activity. What would be the priority for refining the system's handling of such mixed-modal sessions: improving the "run segment" detection logic or developing a dedicated "strength/mixed-modal session" analysis template?
