TASK
----
1. **Analyze the Pre-Run Wellness Context section** (as shown below) in detail. For each metric, comment on its value, trend (Δ1d, Δ7d), and any notable deviations, improvements, or risks. Consider how these wellness factors might impact the athlete's readiness, performance, and recovery for this session. If multiple data sources are present (e.g., Whoop vs Garmin RHR), compare and interpret both. Highlight any discrepancies or patterns that could inform training decisions.

--- Pre-Run Wellness Context (Data for 2025-05-14, from `run_summary.txt`) ---
  HRV (Whoop): 105.8 ms (Δ1d: -8.0%, Δ7d: +33.0%)
  RHR (Whoop): 58.0 bpm (Δ1d: +9.4%, Δ7d: +0.0%)
  RHR (Garmin): 53.0 bpm (Δ1d: +10.4%, Δ7d: +0.0%)
  Recovery Score (Whoop): 82.0 % (Δ1d: -9.9%, Δ7d: +110.3%)
  Sleep Score (Whoop): 82.0 % (Δ1d: +6.5%, Δ7d: -3.5%)
  Body Battery (Garmin): 34.5 % (Δ1d: -37.5%, Δ7d: -26.1%)
  Avg Stress (Garmin, Prev Day): n/a
  Sleep Duration (Whoop): 8.7 h (Δ1d: -25.7%, Δ7d: +15.7%)
  Sleep Consistency (Whoop): 68.0 % (Δ1d: +142.9%, Δ7d: -1.4%)
  Sleep Disturbances/hr (Whoop): 1.3  (Δ1d: +166.7%, Δ7d: -22.1%)
  Strain Score (Whoop): 12.5  (Δ1d: -18.2%, Δ7d: -13.3%)
  Skin Temp (Whoop): 90.7 °F (Δ1d: +171.5%, Δ7d: +175.1%) (Note: This large delta for Skin Temp seems anomalous, likely an outlier or data entry issue for previous days.)
  Resp Rate (Whoop): 16.8 rpm (Δ1d: +1.1%, Δ7d: +1.8%)
  Steps (Garmin): 6795.0  (Δ1d: -16.5%, Δ7d: -35.0%)
  Total Activity (Garmin): 108.5 min (Δ1d: -26.0%, Δ7d: -9.0%)
  Resp Rate (Garmin): 14.8 rpm (Δ1d: +0.8%, Δ7d: +4.5%)
  VO2max (Garmin): 54.0 ml/kg/min (Δ1d: n/a, Δ7d: +0.0%)

2. Continue with the standard audit: compare planned vs. actual, surface key metrics, inconsistencies, and actionable steps as usual.

3. Extract **planned workout targets** from `cultivation/outputs/training_plans/baseox_daily_plans/week20/Week20_Wed_2025-05-14_Z2_CADENCE_RUN.md` and `cultivation/outputs/training_plans/baseox_daily_plans/week20/GOAL.md`.

4. Load **zone definitions**:
   • Primary: Parse `cultivation/data/zones_personal.yml` for `model`, HR & pace breakpoints.
   • Cross-verify with `cultivation/outputs/training_plans/pace-zones.md`; flag discrepancies as critical.

5. Parse **actual performance** from `cultivation/outputs/figures/week20/20250514_174726_lunch_good_cadence_work_168_Z3Z4run_RW_hot/txt/`.

6. Generate the analysis report using house layout.

🏃‍♂️:
**Analysis of Pre-Run Wellness Context (Data for 2025-05-14):**

*   **HRV (Whoop): 105.8 ms (Δ1d: -8.0%, Δ7d: +33.0%)**
    *   Value: 105.8 ms is a strong absolute HRV.
    *   Trend: A slight dip (-8.0%) from the previous day is notable, suggesting some acute stress or incomplete recovery. However, the 7-day trend is very positive (+33.0%), indicating good adaptation over the week.
    *   Impact: The daily dip might suggest caution, but the high absolute value and strong weekly trend are generally favorable.
*   **RHR (Whoop): 58.0 bpm (Δ1d: +9.4%, Δ7d: +0.0%)**
    *   Value: 58 bpm is a decent RHR.
    *   Trend: A 9.4% increase from the previous day is significant and typically signals increased physiological stress or incomplete recovery. The 7-day trend is stable.
    *   Impact: This daily increase is a warning sign for readiness.
*   **RHR (Garmin): 53.0 bpm (Δ1d: +10.4%, Δ7d: +0.0%)**
    *   Value: 53 bpm is a good RHR.
    *   Trend: Similar to Whoop, a 10.4% daily increase is a significant indicator of stress/fatigue. 7-day trend is stable.
    *   Comparison: Both Whoop and Garmin show a substantial RHR increase, reinforcing the concern. Garmin's RHR is consistently lower than Whoop's.
*   **Recovery Score (Whoop): 82.0 % (Δ1d: -9.9%, Δ7d: +110.3%)**
    *   Value: 82% is a good recovery score.
    *   Trend: A 9.9% drop from the previous day aligns with the HRV dip and RHR increase, suggesting reduced readiness. The 7-day trend is exceptionally strong, indicating a good recovery trajectory over the week.
    *   Impact: Good overall recovery, but today might be slightly compromised.
*   **Sleep Score (Whoop): 82.0 % (Δ1d: +6.5%, Δ7d: -3.5%)**
    *   Value: 82% is a good sleep score.
    *   Trend: Improved from the previous day. Slightly down over 7 days but still good.
    *   Impact: Good sleep should support performance.
*   **Body Battery (Garmin): 34.5 % (Δ1d: -37.5%, Δ7d: -26.1%)**
    *   Value: 34.5% is very low and indicates poor readiness/high accumulated stress.
    *   Trend: Significant drops both daily and weekly.
    *   Impact: This is a major red flag for performance and suggests the athlete might struggle or accumulate excessive stress.
*   **Sleep Duration (Whoop): 8.7 h (Δ1d: -25.7%, Δ7d: +15.7%)**
    *   Value: 8.7h is excellent sleep duration.
    *   Trend: The daily drop of -25.7% is very large and likely an error or misinterpretation of the delta, as 8.7h is a high absolute value. The weekly trend is positive.
    *   Impact: Assuming 8.7h is correct, this is very supportive.
*   **Sleep Consistency (Whoop): 68.0 % (Δ1d: +142.9%, Δ7d: -1.4%)**
    *   Value: 68% is fair, could be better.
    *   Trend: Massive daily improvement (suggesting the previous day was very low). Stable weekly.
    *   Impact: Improved consistency is good.
*   **Sleep Disturbances/hr (Whoop): 1.3 (Δ1d: +166.7%, Δ7d: -22.1%)**
    *   Value: 1.3 disturbances/hr is acceptable.
    *   Trend: Significant daily increase, suggesting more restless sleep than the prior night, despite a good overall score. Weekly trend is good.
    *   Impact: Could contribute to feeling less than fully refreshed.
*   **Strain Score (Whoop): 12.5 (Δ1d: -18.2%, Δ7d: -13.3%)**
    *   Value: Indicates moderate strain the previous day.
    *   Trend: Lower strain than the day before and the weekly average, suggesting a relatively easier prior day.
    *   Impact: Should support better readiness, though other metrics contradict this.
*   **Skin Temp (Whoop): 90.7 °F (Δ1d: +171.5%, Δ7d: +175.1%)**
    *   Value: Within a typical range.
    *   Trend: The deltas are extremely large and almost certainly indicate missing or incorrect baseline data for previous days. These deltas should be disregarded as noise.
    *   Impact: No reliable impact assessment from trend.
*   **Steps (Garmin): 6795.0 (Δ1d: -16.5%, Δ7d: -35.0%)**
    *   Value: Low to moderate activity.
    *   Trend: Decreased daily and weekly, suggesting less non-exercise activity.
    *   Impact: Could mean more rest, or just less movement.

**Overall Wellness Interpretation:**
There are mixed signals. Strong absolute HRV, good Whoop Recovery and Sleep scores, and high sleep duration are positive. However, the significant daily RHR increase (both Garmin and Whoop) and very low Garmin Body Battery are major concerns for readiness. The athlete might be on a knife-edge: well-recovered over the longer term (7d trends for HRV/Recovery) but facing acute stress today. The plan's "Amber Light" conditions (reduce run to 10-12 min, Z1 HR) or even "Red Light" (walk/rest) should be seriously considered.

---

**0 · TL;DR**
This session was executed in very hot conditions (32.7°C) with concerning pre-run wellness signals (elevated RHR, low Body Battery). The "run" portion significantly exceeded the planned Z2 HR target, averaging 175 bpm (Z3/Z4), and was shorter than the minimum planned. Cadence during the run was good (167.6 spm), nearing the target, but the intensity deviation makes this a ❌ failed Z2 cadence run.

| Fatigue Flags      | Elevated RHR, Low BB | Green Light    | ❌     | Wellness signals suggested an Amber/Red day. Likely contributed to poor HR control and high effort. |

**2 · Root-Cause / Consistency Notes**

*   **Plan Adherence:** The primary goal of a "Short Easy Z2 Run + High Cadence" was missed due to excessive HR. The run was neither "Easy Z2" nor did it meet duration targets.
*   **Wellness Interpretation:** Pre-run wellness metrics (elevated RHR on both Whoop/Garmin, very low Garmin Body Battery) strongly indicated an "Amber" or "Red" light day according to the `GOAL.md` plan. Proceeding with a "Green Light" intensity was a misjudgment.
*   **Environmental Factors:** Extreme heat (32.7°C / ~91°F) as per `weather.txt` and "hot" in filename significantly impacted HR and perceived effort. This makes Z2 HR control very difficult.
*   **Data Discrepancy (HR Drift):** `advanced_metrics.txt` (run portion) shows `decoupling_%: 7.77%`. `hr_over_time_drift.txt` (for the primary activity segment of 27.4 mins) shows `hr_drift_pct: -7.58%`. This negative drift for the activity is due to initial higher HR spikes followed by lower HR during walk portions or later run segments. The positive 7.77% for the "run_metrics" (10.1 min) likely reflects the continuous high effort part.
*   **Zone Definitions:**
    *   `cultivation/data/zones_personal.yml` (implied by `advanced_metrics.txt`):
        *   HRmax: 201 bpm
        *   Model: AeT-anchored
        *   Z1: 0-145, Z2: 145-160, Z3: 161-175, Z4: 176-186, Z5: 187-201
    *   `cultivation/outputs/training_plans/pace-zones.md`: Confirms AeT-anchored model for Base-Ox, Z2: 145-160 bpm.
    *   **Consistency:** ✅ Zones are consistent.
*   **File Analysis:**
    *   `advanced_metrics.txt`: Provides key run segment data (1.52km, 10.1min, 175bpm avg HR). Used for KPI dashboard.
    *   `cadence_distribution.txt`: Mean 167.6, Std 7.44 for the run segment (607 data points = 10.1 min). Confirms cadence target met.
    *   `hr_distribution.txt`: Mean 175.0 for the run segment. Shows HR mostly in Z3/Z4.
    *   `hr_over_time_drift.txt`: Shows -7.58% drift for the main activity (27.4 min), likely influenced by run/walk and HR settling after initial high.
    *   `hr_vs_pace_hexbin.txt`: Correlation -0.229, weak negative correlation as expected (faster pace generally means higher HR, but min/km pace means lower number is faster).
    *   `pace_distribution.txt`: Mean 6.8 min/km for the run segment.
    *   `pace_over_time.txt`: Positive split for the run segment (6.78 first half, 6.92 second half), indicating slowing down.
    *   `power_distribution.txt`: `count 0.0` - No power data.
    *   `run_only_summary.txt`: Data consistent with `advanced_metrics.txt`.
    *   `run_summary.txt`: Contains pre-run wellness. Main summary stats (27.5 min activity, 3.55km, avg HR 175) reflect the Garmin activity, not just the filtered run portion for advanced metrics. This is confusing as "Avg HR: 175.0" is listed under "Run Summary" but seems to be for the 10.1 min run part from advanced_metrics, yet total distance/duration is for the whole activity.
    *   `session_full_summary.txt`: 4.03km, 37.4 min, avg HR 149.3. This captures the entire session including warm-up/cool-down walks.
    *   `stride_summary.txt`: `Stride segments detected: 0`. No strides.
    *   `time_in_effective_zone.txt`: Relates to combined HR/Pace zones, mostly "mixed". Not directly useful for Z2 HR adherence. (Total 1645s = 27.4 min activity).
    *   `time_in_fatigue_kpi_zone.txt`: (27.4 min activity) High Intensity (Z4+) 24.6%, Threshold (Z3) 8.9%. Confirms high intensity.
    *   `time_in_hr_zone.txt`: (27.4 min activity) Z3: 8.9%, Z4: 18.5%, Z5: 6.1%. Very little time in Z2 (12.8%), and Z1 (53.6%) due to walks.
    *   `time_in_pace_zone.txt`: (27.4 min activity) Mostly Z3 pace (49.5%) and Z4 pace (24.5%).
    *   `walk_hr_distribution.txt`: Walk HRs span a wide range, many in Z1/Z2.
    *   `walk_over_time.txt`: Detailed walk segment data.
    *   `walk_pace_distribution.txt`: Walk paces are varied as expected.
    *   `walk_segments.csv`: CSV for walk segments.
    *   `walk_summary.txt`: 59.1% of session was walking (22 min). Avg walk HR 153.2 (Z2).
    *   `weather.txt`: Temp 32.7°C, Clear. Critical context.

**3 · Target vs Actual**

*   **Session Intent (from `Week20_Wed_2025-05-14_Z2_CADENCE_RUN.md`):**
    *   Type: "Short Easy Z2 Run + High Cadence"
    *   Purpose: "Aerobic maintenance with strong technical focus on cadence, promote recovery."
    *   Planned Run Duration: 15-20 min.
    *   HR Target: Easy Zone 2 (Target HR < 160bpm, aim for 145-155bpm range).
    *   Cadence Target: 165-170 spm (METRONOME ON).
    *   Notes: "Walk Breaks: Take short (15-30s) walk breaks if HR starts to exceed 158bpm, or if cadence form breaks down. Resume running when HR drops." "This run should feel genuinely easy."

*   **Actual Performance:**
    *   **Run Portion (10.1 min, 1.52 km):**
        *   Avg HR: 175.0 bpm (Significantly above Z2, mostly Z3/Z4).
        *   Avg Cadence: 167.6 spm (✅ Target met).
        *   Avg Pace: 6.67 min/km (6:40/km or 10:44/mi).
    *   **Full Session (37.4 min, 4.03 km):**
        *   Avg HR: 149.3 bpm (pulled down by extensive walking).
        *   Walk time: 22 min 07s (59.1%).
    *   **Environment:** Very hot (32.7°C / 91°F).

*   **Highlights:**
    *   Cadence target (165-170 spm) was successfully met during the run portion (avg 167.6 spm).
    *   Significant walking was incorporated, which was appropriate given the heat and likely high effort.

*   **Limiters:**
    *   **Wellness:** Pre-run wellness signals (elevated RHR, low Body Battery) were not heeded appropriately. An "Amber" or "Red" light modification from `GOAL.md` should have been applied (e.g., "Amber Light: Reduce run to 10-12 minutes. Strict Z1 / very low Z2 HR (<150bpm). Maintain cadence focus but prioritize overall ease.").
    *   **Heat:** Extreme temperature made low HR running exceptionally difficult.
    *   **Intensity Discipline:** The run portion was executed at Z3/Z4 intensity, completely missing the Z2 target. This negates the "aerobic maintenance" and "promote recovery" goals. The run was not "genuinely easy."
    *   **Duration:** The run portion (10.1 min) was shorter than the planned minimum of 15 minutes.

**4 · Action Plan**

1.  **Immediate:** Prioritize recovery for the next 24-48 hours. Given the high HR, heat stress, and poor pre-run wellness, the actual physiological cost was likely higher than hrTSS suggests.
2.  **Wellness Protocol:** Strictly adhere to the "Green/Amber/Red Light" system outlined in `GOAL.md` for Week 20. If similar wellness signals appear, apply the prescribed modifications (reduce volume/intensity, or rest).
3.  **Heat Adaptation:** For runs in such high temperatures (>30°C), Z2 HR targets may need to be abandoned in favor of RPE, or runs shifted to cooler parts of the day. Alternatively, accept significantly slower paces or use treadmill in controlled environment to hit Z2 HR.
4.  **Review `run_summary.txt` generation:** Clarify which "Avg HR" is being reported in the main summary section of `run_summary.txt`. It currently states "Avg HR: 175.0" which seems to be from the `advanced_metrics` run portion, but other stats in that section are for the whole activity. This can be misleading. The `session_full_summary.txt` (avg HR 149.3) and `advanced_metrics.txt` (avg HR 175.0 for run part) provide clearer distinct views.
5.  **Log Session Outcome:** Mark this session as "off-target" for Z2 HR control in any subjective logs or weekly review.
