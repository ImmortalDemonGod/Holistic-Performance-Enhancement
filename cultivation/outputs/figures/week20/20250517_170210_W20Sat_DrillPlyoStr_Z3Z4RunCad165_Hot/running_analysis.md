TASK
----
1. **Analyze the Pre-Run Wellness Context section** (as shown below) in detail. For each metric, comment on its value, trend (Δ1d, Δ7d), and any notable deviations, improvements, or risks. Consider how these wellness factors might impact the athlete's readiness, performance, and recovery for this session. If multiple data sources are present (e.g., Whoop vs Garmin RHR), compare and interpret both. Highlight any discrepancies or patterns that could inform training decisions.

--- Pre-Run Wellness Context (Data for 2025-05-17 from `run_summary.txt`) ---
   HRV (Whoop): 111.9 ms (Δ1d: +12.4%, Δ7d: +31.8%)
   RHR (Whoop): 53.0 bpm (Δ1d: -5.4%, Δ7d: -7.0%)
   RHR (Garmin): 50.0 bpm (Δ1d: -3.8%, Δ7d: -3.8%)
   Recovery Score (Whoop): 89.0 % (Δ1d: +15.6%, Δ7d: +78.0%)

   Resp Rate (Whoop): 16.9 rpm (Δ1d: +3.2%, Δ7d: +0.7%)
   Steps (Garmin): 9459.0  (Δ1d: +300%+, Δ7d: -53.7%)
   Total Activity (Garmin): 108.6 min (Δ1d: +144.9%, Δ7d: -41.1%)
   Resp Rate (Garmin): 16.0 rpm (Δ1d: +7.6%, Δ7d: +6.1%)
   VO2max (Garmin): 54.0 ml/kg/min (Δ1d: n/a, Δ7d: +0.0%)

2. Continue with the standard audit: compare planned vs. actual, surface key metrics, inconsistencies, and actionable steps as usual.

3. Extract **planned workout targets** from `cultivation/outputs/training_plans/baseox_daily_plans/week20/Week20_Sat_2025-05-17_ECONOMY_DEV_2.md`.

4. Load **zone definitions**:
   • Primary: Parse `cultivation/data/zones_personal.yml` (inferred via `advanced_metrics.txt`) for `model`, HR & pace breakpoints.
   • Cross-verify with `cultivation/outputs/training_plans/pace-zones.md`; flag discrepancies as critical.

5. Parse **actual performance** from `cultivation/outputs/figures/week20/20250517_170210_lunch_run/txt/` and `cultivation/outputs/figures/week20/20250517_170210_lunch_run/session_notes.md`.

6. Generate the analysis report using house layout.

**ANALYSIS SCOPE**
--------------
This analysis systematically reviews every file in the `cultivation/outputs/figures/week20/20250517_170210_lunch_run/txt/` directory and `session_notes.md` to provide a comprehensive audit of the session.

**Pre-Run Wellness Context Analysis (Data for 2025-05-17 from `run_summary.txt`)**

*   **HRV (Whoop): 111.9 ms (Δ1d: +12.4%, Δ7d: +31.8%)**
    *   Value: Excellent, significantly above typical baseline.
    *   Trend: Strong positive trend both daily and weekly, indicating very good recovery and readiness.
    *   Impact: Suggests high capacity for training stress and good adaptation.

*   **RHR (Whoop): 53.0 bpm (Δ1d: -5.4%, Δ7d: -7.0%)**
*   **RHR (Garmin): 50.0 bpm (Δ1d: -3.8%, Δ7d: -3.8%)**
    *   Value: Both are low and indicate good recovery. Garmin RHR is slightly lower.
    *   Trend: Both show a positive (decreasing) trend, aligning with HRV.
    *   Impact: Reinforces good readiness.

*   **Recovery Score (Whoop): 89.0 % (Δ1d: +15.6%, Δ7d: +78.0%)**
    *   Value: Very high ("Green" recovery).
    *   Trend: Significant improvement daily and massive improvement weekly.
    *   Impact: Prime condition for a quality session. `session_notes.md` confirms "Wellness light: Green".

*   **Sleep Score (Whoop): 82.0 % (Δ1d: +0.0%, Δ7d: -4.7%)**
    *   Value: Good sleep score.
    *   Trend: Stable daily, slight dip weekly but still good.
    *   Impact: Adequate rest supports performance.

*   **Body Battery (Garmin): 60.9 % (Δ1d: +7.2%, Δ7d: +46.3%)**
    *   Value: Moderate to good.
    *   Trend: Positive daily and weekly trends.
    *   Impact: Suggests reasonable energy levels for the day.

*   **Avg Stress (Garmin, Prev Day): n/a**
    *   Data missing.

*   **Sleep Duration (Whoop): 6.8 h (Δ1d: -26.4%, Δ7d: -5.8%)**
    *   Value: Slightly below ideal for heavy training (often 7-9h recommended).
    *   Trend: Significant decrease from the previous day, and slightly down weekly.
    *   Risk: This is a potential flag. Shorter sleep, despite good scores, might impact peak performance or recovery from a hard session.

*   **Sleep Consistency (Whoop): 66.0 % (Δ1d: +13.8%, Δ7d: -12.0%)**
    *   Value: Fair. Higher is better.
    *   Trend: Improved from yesterday, but down weekly.
    *   Risk: Inconsistent sleep patterns can undermine recovery over time.

*   **Sleep Disturbances/hr (Whoop): 1.0 (Δ1d: +16.0%, Δ7d: -19.6%)**
    *   Value: Low, indicating good sleep quality.
    *   Trend: Slight increase from yesterday, but better than weekly average.
    *   Impact: Good.

*   **Strain Score (Whoop): n/a**
    *   Data missing.

*   **Skin Temp (Whoop): 93.0 °F (Δ1d: +170.9%, Δ7d: +174.4%)**
    *   Value & Trend: These delta values are extremely high and suggest either a unit error (e.g., C to F misinterpretation in the delta calculation) or a sensor issue/anomaly. A 170% increase in skin temperature is physiologically improbable for a daily change.
    *   Risk: If accurate and reflects a true physiological change (e.g. fever), it's a major red flag. Given other wellness metrics are green, this is highly likely an data anomaly. Needs investigation.

*   **Resp Rate (Whoop): 16.9 rpm (Δ1d: +3.2%, Δ7d: +0.7%)**
*   **Resp Rate (Garmin): 16.0 rpm (Δ1d: +7.6%, Δ7d: +6.1%)**
    *   Value: Both are within normal resting ranges. Whoop is slightly higher.
    *   Trend: Minor fluctuations, generally stable. Garmin shows a slightly larger daily increase.
    *   Impact: No major concerns.

*   **Steps (Garmin): 9459.0 (Δ1d: +300%+, Δ7d: -53.7%)**
    *   Value: Moderate activity level for the day of the run.
    *   Trend: Significantly more steps than the previous day, but much less than the weekly average, suggesting the previous day was very low activity, and the week overall had higher activity days.
    *   Impact: Previous day was likely a rest or very light day.

*   **Total Activity (Garmin): 108.6 min (Δ1d: +144.9%, Δ7d: -41.1%)**
    *   Value: Reflects a decent amount of activity for the day.
    *   Trend: Similar pattern to steps.
    *   Impact: Athlete was active on this day beyond just the structured session.

*   **VO2max (Garmin): 54.0 ml/kg/min (Δ1d: n/a, Δ7d: +0.0%)**
    *   Value: Good fitness level.
    *   Trend: Stable.
    *   Impact: Indicates a solid aerobic capacity.

**Overall Wellness Impact:**
Despite a significant drop in sleep duration and a questionable skin temperature reading, the primary readiness indicators (HRV, RHR, Whoop Recovery Score) were excellent, supporting the "Green" light for the session. The body seems well-recovered. The shorter sleep might be a factor if endurance or peak intensity is tested.

**Actual Performance Analysis**

**0 · TL;DR**
The session significantly overran its planned duration, primarily due to extended warm-up and breaks. The run component was executed at a much higher heart rate (Z3/Z4) than the planned Z2, despite good cadence adherence, likely influenced by the hot weather (29.9°C). Wellness indicators were strong pre-session, but the high intensity of the run and overall session RPE for strength elements suggest a demanding workout.

**File-by-File Analysis of Actual Performance:**

*   **`session_notes.md` (Verbal Log):**
    *   **Overall Duration:** Planned 60-75 min, Actual 95 min. Over by 20-35 min.
    *   **Wellness:** Green.
    *   **Drills:** High Knees, A-Skips, C-Skips (plan had B-Skips), B-Skips logged. Butt Kicks skipped.
    *   **Plyometrics:** Ankle Hops, Pogo Jumps, Tuck Jumps executed. RPE 4-7.
    *   **Run Block (17 min):** Cadence target 165-170 spm with metronome. "Struggled early, adapted after alert change." Peak HR 183, RPE 7-8. This RPE is very high for Z2.
    *   **Calisthenics:** Pull-up (1 rep, RPE 10), failed second. Hamstring Walkouts (RPE 7), SL RDL (RPE 6), SL Glute Bridge (RPE 7.5), Hollow Body Hold (16s, RPE 10). Upper body RPE 9, Lower 8, Core 10. This indicates very high exertion.
    *   **Breaks:** Misc rest breaks 10 min. Warm-up extended (16 min), Plyo block 24 min, Cooldown 10 min, Strength 18 min.

*   **`advanced_metrics.txt` (Run Segment):**
    *   `distance_km: 3.13`, `duration_min: 18.8`, `avg_pace_min_per_km: 6.02`, `avg_hr: 170.7`.
    *   `efficiency_factor: 0.01621`, `decoupling_%: 13.16`, `hrTSS: 29.3`.
    *   Zones applied are consistent with AeT-Anchored.

*   **`cadence_distribution.txt` (Run Segment):**
    *   `mean: 164.92 spm`, `std: 8.49 spm`. Median 166 spm. 75% of data is 162-170 spm. Good adherence. Max 234 spm is an outlier/artifact.

*   **`hr_distribution.txt` (Run Segment):**
    *   `mean: 170.74 bpm`, `std: 17.44 bpm`. Median 178 bpm. Confirms run was well above Z2. Min 115, Max 190.

*   **`hr_over_time_drift.txt` (Run Segment):**
    *   `hr_drift_pct: 15.22%` (first_half_hr: 154.35, second_half_hr: 177.83). This specific calculation shows higher drift than the `advanced_metrics.txt` decoupling. The `advanced_metrics.txt` value is usually the canonical one based on pace vs HR relationship.

*   **`hr_vs_pace_hexbin.txt` (Run Segment):**
    *   `Correlation coefficient: -0.405`. Moderate negative correlation; as pace gets faster (lower min/km), HR tends to increase. Expected.

*   **`pace_distribution.txt` (Run Segment):**
    *   `mean: 5.97 min/km`. Median 5.77 min/km.

*   **`pace_over_time.txt` (Run Segment):**
    *   `first_half_pace: 6.42 min/km`, `second_half_pace: 5.69 min/km`. Strategy: "negative". Athlete sped up.

*   **`power_distribution.txt`:**
    *   `count: 0.0`. No power data recorded/available.

*   **`run_only_summary.txt` & `run_summary.txt`:**
    *   These provide summaries that mix the overall recording with the specific run segment metrics from `advanced_metrics.txt`.
    *   `run_summary.txt` confirms weather: `Temperature: 29.9 °C`, `Clear sky`.
    *   The "Run Summary" part (non-advanced) in `run_summary.txt` seems to refer to the longer 7.09km activity: `Duration: 0 days 01:15:16`, `Avg pace (min/km): 5.97`. This is confusing as it's mixed with `advanced_metrics` for the shorter run.
    *   The `run_only_summary.txt` shows: `total_distance_km: 7.085`, `duration: 01:15:16`, `avg_pace_min_per_km: 6.02`, `avg_hr: 170.7`. This implies the *entire 7km activity was considered "run" by one filter*, and its average HR was 170.7. This contrasts with `session_full_summary.txt` which has avg_hr 141.6 for 7.16km / 98 min.
    *   **Discrepancy to investigate**: The filtering for `run_only_summary.txt` seems to have captured a very long, high HR segment if 1:15:16 had an avg HR of 170.7. This needs clarification on what defines "run-only" vs "session_full". The 18.8 min segment from `advanced_metrics.txt` is the most coherent for detailed run analysis.

*   **`session_full_summary.txt` (Entire 98.1 min activity):**
    *   `distance_km: 7.16`, `duration_min: 98.1`, `avg_pace_min_per_km: 13.7`, `avg_hr: 141.6`, `max_hr: 190`.
    *   `efficiency_factor: 0.00859` (very low, expected for mixed activity), `decoupling_%: 21.5` (high), `hrTSS: 87.9` (moderate total).

*   **`stride_summary.txt`:**
    *   `Stride segments detected: 0`. No strides performed or detected during the run segment. Planned drills are separate.

*   **`time_in_effective_zone.txt`, `time_in_fatigue_kpi_zone.txt`, `time_in_hr_zone.txt`, `time_in_pace_zone.txt` (Apply to the 18.8 min run segment):**
    *   `time_in_hr_zone.txt`: `Z1: 56.6%`, `Z2: 24.1%`, `Z3: 5.7%`, `Z4: 7.6%`, `Z5: 6.0%`.
        *   This distribution is confusing. If Avg HR was 170.7, much more time should be in Z3+. Perhaps "Z1" here includes very low HR at start/end of the 18.8 min segment?
        *   The `hr_distribution.txt` has median 178bpm, with 25th percentile at 158bpm. This suggests a significant portion of the run was above Z2.
        *   Let's re-evaluate `% Time in HR Z2` for the dashboard:
            *   Total run seconds = 18.8 * 60 = 1128 seconds.
            *   Seconds in Z2 (145-160bpm) = 1089.0 (from `time_in_hr_zone.txt` file, this seems to be for the *entire session*, not just the run segment based on the high Z1 time).
            *   The `time_in_hr_zone.txt` states: Z1 (0-145): 2556s, Z2 (145-160): 1089s, Z3 (161-175): 259s, Z4 (176-186): 343s, Z5 (187-201): 269s. Total = 4516s (approx 75 min). This is for the main activity part, not just the 18.8 min run.
            *   **Action:** Need a `time_in_hr_zone` specifically for the 18.8 min run segment to accurately assess Z2 compliance. Based on avg HR 170.7 and median 178, very little time was in Z2 for the run. I will mark % in Z2 as low based on avg HR.

*   **`walk_hr_distribution.txt`, `walk_pace_distribution.txt`, `walk_summary.txt`:**
    *   `walk_summary.txt`: `Total walk time: 56 min 13 s (57.3 % of session)`, `Avg walk HR (bpm): 139.1`. This confirms significant walking.

*   **`weather.txt`:**
    *   `Temperature: 29.9 °C`. This is hot and a major factor for elevated HR.

**2 · Root-Cause / Consistency Notes**

*   **High HR during Run:** The primary cause for the run segment being far above the planned Z2 HR (<160bpm) is likely the high ambient temperature (29.9°C).
*   **Data Source for Run Segment:** The 18.8 min run segment identified by `advanced_metrics.txt` (and corroborated by `session_notes.md`'s 17 min run block) is the most reliable for analyzing the specific "run" component's KPIs.
*   **Time in HR Zone Reporting:** The `time_in_hr_zone.txt` file appears to cover a much longer portion of the activity than just the 18.8 min run segment, making it difficult to assess Z2 compliance for the run itself from this file. The average HR of 170.7bpm for the run segment clearly indicates it was not a Z2 run.
*   **`run_only_summary.txt` vs `advanced_metrics.txt`:** There's a significant difference in what these files define as the "run." `advanced_metrics.txt` provides data for a short, distinct run, while `run_only_summary.txt` seems to cover almost the entire active duration of the session with a very high average HR. This suggests the filtering logic for "run_only" might be too broad or picking up non-running high HR periods.
*   **Power Data:** Missing (`power_distribution.txt` is empty). Not planned, but good to note.
*   **Drill Execution:** `session_notes.md` logs "C-Skips" instead of planned "B-Skips" (though B-skips also logged later) and "Butt Kicks" were skipped. Minor deviations.
*   **Skin Temperature Anomaly:** The Whoop Skin Temp Δ1d and Δ7d values in `run_summary.txt` are exceptionally high and warrant investigation for data error.

**3 · Target vs Actual**

*   **Session Intent:**
    *   Planned: Neuromuscular & Economy Development 2 (Plyo Focus) + Short Z2 Run (60-75 min total). Focus on running mechanics, reactive strength, cadence, and calisthenics.
    *   Actual: Session extended to 95 min. Wellness Green. Components generally followed plan structure but with modifications and higher than expected intensity/RPE for run and strength.

*   **Highlights:**
    *   **Cadence Target Met:** Average cadence of 164.9 spm for the run was on target (165-170 spm) with metronome use.
    *   **Wellness:** Excellent pre-session wellness scores provided a good foundation.
    *   **Completion of Complex Session:** Despite deviations, the multi-component session (drills, plyos, run, strength) was completed.
    *   **Negative Split:** The run segment was executed with a negative split (`pace_over_time.txt`).
    *   **Strength Effort:** Calisthenics were performed to high RPEs, indicating significant effort (RPEs 8-10 noted in `session_notes.md`).

*   **Limiters & Deviations:**
    *   **Run Intensity:** The run was performed at an average HR of 170.7 bpm (Z3), not the planned Z2 (<160bpm). This was likely due to the **29.9°C heat**. RPE 7-8 for the run (`session_notes.md`) also confirms high effort.
    *   **Overall Duration:** Session was 95 min vs. 60-75 min planned. Attributed to extended warm-up and misc breaks (`session_notes.md`).
    *   **Efficiency Factor & Drift:** EF (0.01621) was below baseline and HR drift (13.16%) was high for the run, consistent with high HR and heat.
    *   **Strength Execution:** While RPE was high, `session_notes.md` indicates a failed pull-up attempt and reps not captured for one exercise, suggesting load/fatigue challenges.
    *   **Walk Time:** Significant portion of the session was walking (57.3%), suggesting active recovery between high-effort segments.

**4 · Action Plan**

1.  **Acknowledge Heat Impact:** Recognize that the 29.9°C temperature was a primary driver of high HR during the run. For future Z2 runs in similar heat, either adjust pace significantly downwards to maintain HR target, shorten duration, or shift to cooler times of day.
2.  **Review Run Filtering:** Investigate the discrepancy between `run_only_summary.txt` (75 min run at 170bpm avg HR) and `advanced_metrics.txt` (18.8 min run at 170bpm avg HR). The latter seems more aligned with the planned "short Z2 run" component and `session_notes.md`. Ensure `run_metrics.py` correctly identifies the intended "run" segment for analysis.
3.  **Time in Zone for Run Segment:** If possible, generate `time_in_hr_zone.txt` specifically for the 18.8-minute run segment to get precise Z2 compliance data for future analyses.
4.  **Calisthenics Load Management:** Given RPE 9-10 on several calisthenics, monitor recovery and consider if progressions are appropriate or if volume/intensity needs adjustment for sustainable execution, especially after other demanding elements.
5.  **Data Anomaly Check:** Investigate the Whoop Skin Temperature reporting in `run_summary.txt` for potential errors in data pipeline or interpretation.
6.  **Session Duration Management:** Review components (warm-up, transition times) to see where time can be managed better if sticking to the 60-75 min target is a priority. The current 95 min reflects a more leisurely approach or higher need for recovery between elements.

This session was demanding due to heat and high effort across components. The key learning is the significant impact of environment on Z2 HR targets and the need for clear run segment identification for accurate KPI tracking. What is the primary method for distinguishing the main "run" segment from other parts of a complex session like this for `run_metrics.py` processing?
