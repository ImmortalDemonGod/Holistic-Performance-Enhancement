    internal_note: "Card 1: Programmatically generated. For detailed testing. (Authorable from YAML)"

  # Card 2: Minimal (auto-generates UUID, inherits global tags)
  - q: What is the minimum required to define a card?
    a: A question (`q`) and an answer (`a`).

  # Card 3: Card-level tags, media (with subdirectory), and origin_task
  - q: Which fields are optional for a card in YAML?
    a: |
      Optional fields per card entry:
      - `id` (UUID string)
      - `tags` (list of kebab-case strings)
      - `origin_task` (string)
      - `media` (list of relative path strings)
      - `internal_note` (string, if supported from YAML)
    tags:
      - optional-fields
      - reference-schema
    origin_task: DOC-REF-123
    media:
      - "diagrams/card_schema.png" # Resides in assets/diagrams/card_schema.png

  # Card 4: Card with explicitly empty card-level tags
  - q: What happens if a card has 'tags: []'?
    a: It inherits only the global tags from the deck file. The empty list overrides nothing.
    tags: []

  # Card 5: Card with only global tags, no card-level tags field (implicitly empty)
  - q: How are global tags applied if a card has no 'tags' field?
    a: Global tags from the YAML file are applied. It's equivalent to `tags: []`.

  # Card 6: Multi-line answer and markdown, showcasing 'internal_note'
  - q: What is the purpose of the `internal_note` field in the Card model?
    a: |
      The `internal_note` field (if supported from YAML) is for system or author notes not shown to the user during review.
      - Useful for tracking generation source or special handling instructions.
      - Example: "This card's answer needs KaTeX rendering."
    internal_note: "Card 6: Focus on internal_note's purpose if it's authorable."
