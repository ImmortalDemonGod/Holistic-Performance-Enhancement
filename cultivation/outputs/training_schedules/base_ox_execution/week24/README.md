# Week 24: Aerobic Consolidation & Durability Probe

**Week Dates:** June 9-15, 2025  
**Phase:** Base-Ox (Consolidation)  
**Primary Objective:** Test aerobic system durability and efficiency limits while maintaining high-quality execution standards.

## Week Overview

This week represents a critical consolidation phase following the high-intensity work of Week 23. The primary focus is on:

1. **Aerobic System Durability Testing** - Saturday's 3-4 hour limit probe
2. **Technical Precision** - Strict HR control and cadence focus across all sessions
3. **Data Generation** - Comprehensive performance metrics for system optimization

## Daily Schedule

| Day | Date | Session Type | Duration | Key Focus |
|-----|------|--------------|----------|-----------|
| Mon | 2025-06-09 | Full Rest | N/A | Recovery & Planning |
| Tue | 2025-06-10 | Z2 Quality Volume | 75-90 min | HR Control & Cadence |
| Wed | 2025-06-11 | NME1 (Strength) | ~60 min | Neuromuscular Development |
| Thu | 2025-06-12 | Z2 Recovery | 40-50 min | Active Recovery |
| Fri | 2025-06-13 | Optional Z2 | 25-35 min | Conditional Bonus Volume |
| Sat | 2025-06-14 | **LIMIT PROBE** | 3-4 hours | Durability Testing |
| Sun | 2025-06-15 | Full Rest | N/A | Recovery & Analysis |

## Key Performance Targets

- **Heart Rate Control:** Strict adherence to Zone 2 caps (158bpm max for quality sessions, 155bpm for recovery)
- **Cadence Consistency:** 167-170 spm across all running sessions
- **Efficiency Factor:** Target >0.0180 for quality sessions
- **Wellness Integration:** Full G/A/R system implementation for session modifications

## Success Metrics

1. **Completion of Saturday's limit probe** with excellent HR control
2. **Consistent cadence execution** across all running sessions
3. **High-quality data capture** for system optimization
4. **Appropriate autoregulation** based on daily wellness metrics

## Integration Notes

- All sessions integrate with existing `run-metrics` CI/CD pipeline
- Wellness data feeds into G/A/R decision matrix
- Saturday's session generates critical dataset for Week 25 deload planning
- Files follow established naming conventions for automated processing
