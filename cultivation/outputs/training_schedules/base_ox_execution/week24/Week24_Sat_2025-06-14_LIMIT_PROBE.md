# Week 24 - Saturday: LIMIT PROBE: Extreme Duration Aerobic Run

**Session Focus & Type:** Extreme Duration Aerobic Run
**Planned Approx. Duration:** 3 to 4 hours (180-240 min)

## Execution Checklist:

**1. Daily Wellness Check (MANDATORY):**
    *   Review wellness. Assign G/A/R light. This is a very demanding session; a strong Green light is highly recommended.

**2. Logistics & Nutrition (PRE-RUN):**
    *   **[ ]** Route planned.
    *   **[ ]** Hydration plan ready (water + electrolytes).
    *   **[ ]** Nutrition plan ready (gels/carbs, aiming for 60-90g/hour after the first 60-75 min).

**3. Main Run (3-4 hours):**
    *   **[ ] HR Control:** **CRITICAL.** Strict cap in low Zone 2 **(<155bpm).** Start in Z1 and let HR rise naturally. Walk, do not hesitate, to keep HR from exceeding the cap.
    *   **[ ] Pacing:** Start extremely conservatively. Your pace will and should slow significantly in the later stages to maintain HR control. This is expected.
    *   **[ ] Cadence:** Aim for 167-170spm for as long as good form allows. Note when/if it starts to decay.
    *   **[ ] Nutrition/Hydration:** Execute your plan precisely.

**4. Data Focus (Mental Notes during run):**
    *   Note your RPE every 30-45 minutes.
    *   Note when you take in fuel/fluids.
    *   Pay attention to any form breakdown or muscular fatigue hotspots.

## Key Focus Points for Today:

*   This is an **experiment in durability**, not a race. Success is defined by completing the duration with excellent HR control.
*   **Patience and discipline** are the most important skills for this session.

## Wellness-Based Adjustments (G/A/R System):

*   💚 **Green Light:** Proceed as planned, but be ready to shorten duration if your body sends strong negative signals.
*   💛 **Amber Light:** **Significantly reduce duration.** Target 90-120 minutes instead of 3-4 hours. Do not attempt the full duration.
*   ❤️ **Red Light:** **SKIP.** Replace with a short Z1/Z2 run (30-45 min) or full rest. **DO NOT ATTEMPT THIS SESSION.**

## System & Data Logging Instructions:

*   Log RPE, nutrition, and any subjective notes in detail post-run.
*   Analyze the output data with a focus on:
    *   Pace vs. HR Decoupling over the full duration.
    *   The point at which EF begins to significantly decline.
    *   The point at which cadence begins to decay.
