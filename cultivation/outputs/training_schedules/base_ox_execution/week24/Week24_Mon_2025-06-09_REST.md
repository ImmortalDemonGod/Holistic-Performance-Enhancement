# Week 24 - Monday: Full Rest & Strategic Planning

**Session Focus & Type:** Full Rest & Strategic Planning
**Planned Approx. Duration:** N/A

## Today's Plan:

1.  **Complete Rest:**
    *   No structured exercise. Avoid strenuous physical activity.

2.  **Focus on Recovery & Preparation:**
    *   **Nutrition:** Prioritize whole foods, adequate protein (~1.8-2.2g/kg), and hydration to support recovery and adaptation from last week's high-intensity efforts.
    *   **Logistics Planning:**
        *   Review the route for Saturday's extreme duration run.
        *   Plan your nutrition/hydration strategy for Saturday (e.g., target 60-90g carbs/hour, calculate fluid/electrolyte needs).
    *   **Mental Preparation:** Review the goals for the week, particularly the focus on high-quality aerobic volume and strict HR control.

3.  **Wellness Logging:**
    *   Diligently log all wellness metrics (HRV, RHR, Sleep, etc.). This data establishes the baseline for the week's G/A/R decisions.

## Key Focus Points for Today:

*   **Recovery is the work.** Allow your body to absorb the stimuli from Week 23.
*   **Strategic foresight.** A successful 3-4 hour run on Saturday depends on the logistical planning done today.

## System & Data Logging Instructions:

*   Ensure `sync-habitdash.yml` runs successfully to capture today's full wellness data.
*   No new session data to process.
