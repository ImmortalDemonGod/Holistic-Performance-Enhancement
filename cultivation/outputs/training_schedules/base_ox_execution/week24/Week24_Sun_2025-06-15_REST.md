# Week 24 - Sunday: Full Rest & Data Analysis

**Session Focus & Type:** Full Rest & Data Analysis
**Planned Approx. Duration:** N/A

## Today's Plan:

1.  **Full Rest & Aggressive Recovery:**
    *   **NO structured exercise.**
    *   Prioritize sleep (allow for longer duration if needed).
    *   Focus on high-quality nutrition (protein, complex carbs) and hydration to replenish stores.
    *   Use mobility and stretching routines as needed to address soreness.

2.  **Data Analysis:**
    *   Process the data from yesterday's long run.
    *   Create the `run_analysis.md` report.
    *   Pay special attention to the decoupling, EF, and cadence decay trends over the full duration.
    *   Begin synthesizing the key learnings from the week to inform the Week 25 deload and assessment plan.

## Key Focus Points for Today:

*   Your body is now in a deep state of adaptation. Providing it with maximum rest is the most productive training you can do today.
*   The data from yesterday's run is invaluable; capturing the insights while they are fresh is key.

## System & Data Logging Instructions:

*   Log all wellness metrics. Expect them to show signs of significant fatigue (lower HRV, higher RHR). This is a normal and expected response.
*   Complete the analysis report for Saturday's run.
