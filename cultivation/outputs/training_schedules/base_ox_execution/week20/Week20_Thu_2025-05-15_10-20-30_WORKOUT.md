# Week 20 - Thursday: 10-20-30 Intensity Workout

**Session Focus & Type:** 10-20-30 Intensity Workout
**Planned Approx. Duration (Total):** 30-35 min

## Execution Checklist:

**1. Daily Wellness Check (MANDATORY BEFORE STARTING):**
    *   Review HRV, RHR, Sleep, Recovery Score, Subjective Feel.
    *   Assign üíö Green, üíõ Amber, or ‚ù§Ô∏è Red light for today's readiness.
    *   **Proceed with adjustments below based on your readiness light.** (This is especially important for an intensity day).

**2. Warm-up (10-12 min):**
    *   Very easy jogging.
    *   Include 2-3 light strides/accelerations (e.g., 40-60m building to ~80% effort) towards the end of the warm-up.
    *   Dynamic stretches if preferred.

**3. Main Workout (10-20-30 Intervals):**
    *   **Structure:** **2 SETS** of [5 repetitions of (30s - 20s - 10s)]
    *   **Between each 5-rep block:** 2 minutes of very slow jogging or walking for recovery.
    *   **Effort Levels for each 1-minute block (30s-20s-10s):**
        *   **30 seconds:** Very easy jog (RPE 2-3/10, "recovery" pace).
        *   **20 seconds:** Moderate pace (RPE 5-6/10, comfortably fast, like a tempo or Z3/Z4 effort).
        *   **10 seconds:** Near-maximal sprint effort (RPE 9/10, as fast as you can sustain with good form for 10s).
    *   **Total "fast" running:** 2 sets * 5 reps * 10s = 100 seconds (1 min 40s).
    *   **Total work + recovery within sets:** 2 sets * 5 min = 10 min. Plus inter-set recovery.

**4. Cool-down (10-12 min):**
    *   Very easy jogging, transitioning to a walk.
    *   Light static stretching.

## Key Focus Points for Today:

*   **Sprint Quality:** The 10-second sprints should be high quality, near maximal effort with good form.
*   **Pacing the "Moderate":** Don't go too hard on the 20-second moderate pace segments, save energy for the sprints.
*   **Full Recovery Between Sets:** Take the full 2 minutes of very easy jog/walk between the two 5-minute blocks.
*   This is a potent stimulus. Focus on the quality of the fast segments.

## Wellness-Based Adjustments for Today:

*   üíö **Green Light:** Proceed with 2 sets as planned.
*   üíõ **Amber Light:**
    *   **Option 1 (Reduce Volume):** Perform only **1 set** of [5 x (30s-20s-10s)].
    *   **Option 2 (Reduce Intensity):** Keep 2 sets, but make the "20s moderate" segment an easy Z2 RPE, and the "10s sprint" segment a strong stride (RPE 7-8/10, not all-out).
    *   Choose the option that feels most appropriate for managing fatigue.
*   ‚ù§Ô∏è **Red Light:** **SKIP THIS WORKOUT.** Replace with an optional very light Z1 walk (20-30 min) if feeling up to it, or take a full rest day. Do NOT attempt intensity on a Red Light day.

## Notes/Reminders:
*   This workout type is effective for improving VO2max and performance despite low total volume (based on Bangsbo et al. study).
*   Pay attention to how your body responds during and after.
