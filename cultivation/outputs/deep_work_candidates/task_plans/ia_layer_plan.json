    "description_objective": "Conduct in-depth research into advanced workflow orchestration tools (e.g., Airflow, Prefect, Dagster, Argo Workflows, or domain-specific WMS like Snakemake/Nextflow) specifically considering the anticipated future needs of the Cultivation project's KCV (Knowledge Creation & Validation) layer. This layer is expected to involve complex, multi-stage, and interdependent data processing, simulation, and machine learning pipelines. The research should result in: 1. A comparative analysis of 2-3 promising tools against the option of continuing with complex GitHub Actions chaining. 2. A small proof-of-concept (PoC) implementation of a representative hypothetical KCV pipeline using the top-ranked tool. 3. An Architecture Decision Record (ADR) summarizing findings, pros/cons of each approach, and providing a clear recommendation and potential migration path/trigger points for adopting a more advanced WMS if/when GitHub Actions becomes insufficient for managing pipeline complexity and operational needs (monitoring, retries, parameterization, dynamic DAGs).",
    "primary_type": "System Design & Research, Prototyping",
    "initial_scale_estimate": "Large (3-5 days for research, PoC, and ADR)",
    "potential_deliverables_outcomes": [
      "A comprehensive ADR (`cultivation/docs/adr/`) on workflow orchestration strategy, including a comparative analysis of tools and a decision matrix.",
      "A functional proof-of-concept for a sample complex workflow implemented in the highest-rated WMS (if a new tool is recommended).",
      "Clear trigger conditions or metrics that would indicate the need to migrate from GitHub Actions chaining to a dedicated WMS.",
      "Enhanced understanding of the operational requirements for future complex data pipelines within Cultivation."
    ],
    "notes_questions_dependencies": "This is a forward-looking strategic task. The KCV layer's design documents mention tools like Snakemake and Nextflow. The ADR should consider factors like ease of Python integration, local development/testing, scalability, monitoring capabilities, community support, and learning curve. For now, GitHub Actions is deemed sufficient as per the IA Layer analysis."
