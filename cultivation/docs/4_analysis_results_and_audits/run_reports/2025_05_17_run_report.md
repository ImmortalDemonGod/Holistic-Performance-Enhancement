# Weekly Running Report: Week 20 (2025-05-12 - 2025-05-18)

**Overarching Theme for Week 20 (from `cultivation/outputs/training_plans/baseox_daily_plans/week20/GOAL.md`):** Neuromuscular Economy & Maximal Recovery Focus. This involves improving running economy via drills, plyos, calisthenics; enhancing neuromuscular power; significantly deloading running volume; maintaining aerobic touchpoint with cadence focus (165-170 spm); and maximizing recovery using a Green/Amber/Red light system.

## 0. Overall Summary (TL;DR)

Week 20 marked a significant shift towards neuromuscular development and reduced running volume, broadly aligning with the new training philosophy. The athlete engaged in planned drills, plyometrics, and calisthenics, with running activities focused on cadence or specific intensity structures. Adherence to the wellness-based Green/Amber/Red light system was critical, particularly evident in the modification or abandonment of the Thursday intensity session due to poor readiness. Cadence targets were generally met during focused run segments. However, execution of run intensity targets (especially Z2 HR) was challenged by very hot weather on multiple days. The overall running volume was substantially lower than Week 19, achieving the planned deload.

## 2. Detailed Session Analyses

### 2.1. Tuesday, 2025-05-13: NME1 (Strength Focus) - `20250513_..._NME1_strength_focus_gps_trace_benchmark`

*   **Plan:** `Week20_Tue_2025-05-13_ECONOMY_DEV_1.md`
*   **Pre-Session Wellness Context (from `run_summary.txt`):**
    *   HRV (Whoop): 115.0 ms (Δ7d: +23.2%) - Excellent
    *   RHR (Whoop/Garmin): 53/48 bpm (Δ7d: -5.4%/-7.7%) - Excellent
    *   Recovery Score (Whoop): 91.0% (Δ7d: +75.0%) - Excellent
    *   Sleep Consistency (Whoop): 28.0% (Δ7d: -51.7%) - Very Poor
    *   Athlete inferred "💛 Amber" light (`session_notes...benchmark.md`). Justified by poor sleep consistency despite other green signals. Heat: 26.5°C at start.
*   **Planned vs. Actual:**
    *   Session aimed to benchmark neuromuscular elements. Executed with modifications due to equipment and fatigue.
    *   Drills: Completed. RPE 6-7.
    *   Plyos: Ankle/Pogo Hops as planned. Low Box Jumps subbed with Tuck Jumps (2x5). Broad Jumps increased to 2x8 reps (planned 2x3-5).
    *   Calisthenics: Significantly reduced to 1 set each (Knee Push-ups 1x9, Pike Push-ups 1x5, Dips 1x2 (failure), Plank 1x50s) due to high RPE (UB 8.5, LB 7.5) and early failure on dips.
*   **Key Metrics & Observations:**
    *   The GPS trace captured 4.42km total activity, with a 0.86km "run segment" (likely drills). This segment's metrics (EF 0.01679, Decoupling 59%) are not meaningful for aerobic assessment.
    *   Max HR during session: 176 bpm (post-plyo, as per `session_full_summary.txt` and session notes).
    *   Session notes detail high RPEs and autoregulation. Heat (26.5°C - 31°C reported) was a factor.
*   **Adherence to Week 20 Goals:**
    *   ✅ Economy/Neuromuscular work: Yes, drills, plyos, calisthenics performed.
    *   ✅ Wellness-Based Adjustments: Yes, calisthenics volume reduced based on RPE/failure. Increased Broad Jump volume was a deviation.

## 3. Weekly Performance Themes & Observations

### 3.1. Adherence to "Neuromuscular Economy & Maximal Recovery Focus"
*   **Economy Work (Drills, Plyos, Calisthenics):** ✅ Successfully integrated on Tue/Sat. Sessions were demanding (high RPEs, autoregulation).
*   **Neuromuscular Power (Plyos, 10-20-30):** ✅ Plyos introduced. ❌ 10-20-30 attempt was largely unsuccessful due to poor readiness.
*   **Running Volume Deload:** ✅ Intentional run segments totaled ~7-8 km / ~43-49 minutes for the week. This is a massive reduction from Week 19's 42.66 km, aligning with the deload goal.
*   **Aerobic Touchpoint & Cadence Focus:** ✅ Cadence targets (165-170 spm) were met or nearly met on Wed/Thu/Sat runs. ❌ Z2 HR targets for Wed/Sat runs were missed, with runs performed at Z3/Z4 intensity, largely due to heat and/or pushing too hard despite wellness signals.
*   **Recovery & Wellness-Based Adjustments:** ⚠️ Mixed.
    *   Tue: Good autoregulation of calisthenics on an "Amber" day.
    *   Wed: Poor decision to run at high intensity despite Amber/Red wellness signals.
    *   Thu: Critical failure to skip intensity on a clear "Red" wellness day.
    *   Sat: Good execution on a "Green" day, though run intensity still high.

### 3.2. Wellness Trends & Impact
*   The week started with some lingering poor sleep consistency (Tue).
*   Wednesday showed concerning RHR spikes and low Body Battery, which should have heavily modified the run.
*   Thursday presented clear "Red Light" wellness data (low HRV, low Recovery Score, poor sleep metrics, high RHR trend) that was not adequately respected, leading to a failed workout.
*   Saturday showed a strong rebound in wellness, allowing for a demanding session.
*   **Key Issue:** Inconsistent application of the G/A/R light system. Wednesday and especially Thursday's sessions should have been significantly altered or skipped.

### 3.3. Cadence Development
*   ✅ Consistent achievement of ~165-168 spm average cadence during the run portions of Wed, Thu, and Sat, when focused with a metronome. This is a positive development.

### 3.4. Impact of Environmental Factors (Heat)
*   🔥 Runs on Wed (32.7°C), Thu (30.0°C), and Sat (29.9°C) were performed in very hot conditions. This significantly contributed to higher HRs for given paces/RPEs and made Z2 HR targets very difficult to achieve.

### 3.5. Running Efficiency (EF) and Decoupling
*   EF for the run segments (Wed: 0.01428, Thu: 0.01679, Sat: 0.01621) were all low and below the >0.018 baseline target. This is expected given the high HRs relative to paces, exacerbated by heat.
*   Decoupling was very high for the 10-20-30 attempt (21%) and the Saturday run (13%), reflecting the intensity and heat stress.

## 4. Progress Towards Week 20 Overarching Goals

*   **Dramatically Improve Running Economy:** Introduced drills, plyos, calisthenics. Too early to see economy improvement in running metrics due to confounding factors (heat, intensity deviations, short run durations). Foundations laid.
*   **Enhance Neuromuscular Power & Reactivity:** Plyos introduced. 10-20-30 attempt was compromised. Mixed progress.
*   **Significantly Deload Overall Running Volume:** ✅ Achieved. Actual run distance (~7-8km) and time (~43-49min) significantly less than Week 19 (~42km).
*   **Maintain Aerobic Touchpoint & Prioritize Cadence:** ✅ Cadence successfully prioritized. ❌ Aerobic touchpoint (Z2 HR) missed due to high HRs in runs.
*   **Maximize Recovery & Adaptability:** ⚠️ Inconsistent application of G/A/R system. Missed opportunities for true recovery/modification on Wed/Thu.

## 5. Action Plan & Recommendations for Week 21

1.  **Reinforce Wellness Protocol:**
    *   **Strict adherence to G/A/R Light System:** This is paramount. Review wellness data *critically* before each session and apply the plan's prescribed modifications without compromise, especially for "Red Light" days.
    *   Consider automating a "Readiness Recommendation" based on key thresholds in wellness data.
2.  **Manage Heat:**
    *   For Z2 runs in >25-28°C, either:
        *   Prioritize RPE 2-3 and let HR/Pace be outcomes.
        *   Shift runs to coolest part of the day.
        *   Use a treadmill in a controlled environment.
    *   For NME/Intensity sessions in heat, extend recovery periods and monitor HR closely.
3.  **Z2 Run Execution:** Re-focus on achieving true Z2 HR (<160bpm, ideally 145-155bpm) for planned Z2 runs, even if it means very slow paces or more walk breaks, especially in heat. Cadence focus can be maintained.
4.  **10-20-30 Workout:** Re-attempt only on a "Green Light" day with favorable weather. Consider starting with 1 set if new or conditions are marginal.
5.  **NME Sessions:**
    *   Continue with planned progressions.
    *   Monitor RPEs and muscular fatigue closely, especially for calisthenics, and autoregulate sets/reps if needed.
    *   Ensure adequate recovery between plyometric exercises (90-120s active recovery).
6.  **Data Pipeline & Analysis:**
    *   Investigate and resolve the Whoop Skin Temperature data anomaly.
    *   Clarify "run segment" definition used by `run_only_summary.txt` vs. `advanced_metrics.txt` to ensure consistent analysis of specific run blocks within mixed-modal sessions.
    *   For mixed-modal NME sessions, prioritize qualitative session notes and RPEs over automated running metrics for the non-running components. The current GPS trace analysis is best suited for the dedicated run blocks.

## 6. Appendix: Weekly Running Volume
