### **Weekly Running Report: Week 22 (2025-05-27 to 2025-05-31)**

**Preamble: Block Objective & Context**
Week 22 marked the first week of the "Synergistic Performance Amplification" block, designed to build upon the "monster" performance of the Week 21 RPE10 test. The plan for this week aimed to re-establish a quality aerobic base, systematically introduce neuromuscular stimuli, and begin probing threshold capabilities, all while being strictly governed by the Green/Amber/Red (G/A/R) wellness protocol.

---
### **I. Overall Week 22 Summary & Key Themes**

Week 22 was a week of **remarkable physiological performance juxtaposed with significant deviations from the training plan's intent and safety protocols.** The athlete demonstrated an exceptional, newly established level of fitness, particularly in aerobic efficiency (achieving a breakthrough Z2 EF) and lactate threshold durability (a stunning long threshold run). However, this was often achieved by overriding planned intensities or ignoring critical wellness signals (especially acute sleep deprivation), culminating in a high-risk, high-reward session on Saturday.

**Key Learnings from Week 22:**
1.  **Breakthrough in Aerobic Efficiency:** The athlete is now capable of achieving an Efficiency Factor (EF) > 0.0185 in Zone 2, a key milestone.
2.  **Quantified NME Impact:** The Wednesday session provided a clear, quantifiable measure of the fatigue cost of NME work on subsequent aerobic running, seen in a 15% decoupling rate.
3.  **Elite Threshold Durability:** Saturday's long threshold run, despite being off-plan and on low sleep, revealed an elite-level ability to resist cardiovascular drift during a prolonged high-intensity effort.
4.  **Major Protocol Adherence Issues:** The G/A/R system was not consistently followed, particularly for the Saturday session, highlighting a critical area for improvement in managing long-term progress and sustainability.

### **II. Detailed Session Audits**

#### **A. Tuesday, 2025-05-27: The "Model Autoregulation" Z2 Run**

*   **Run:** `20250527_171137_W22_Tue_Z2_EF187_On_Amber_Wellness_Cad171`
*   **Plan:** 40-50 min Z1/Z2 Easy Run, HR < 155bpm, Cadence 167-172 spm.
*   **Pre-Run Wellness:** "Amber" light. Key flags were a significant 1-day drop in HRV (-20.7%) and a sharp 1-day increase in RHR (+17%).
*   **Analysis:** This session was a **textbook example of successful autoregulation**. Despite poor acute wellness, the athlete executed the "run-only" portion with exceptional quality by using a strategic 34% walk ratio to manage overall load.
    *   **KPIs (Run-Only Segment - 35.4 min):**
        *   **Avg HR:** 153.9 bpm (✅ Perfect Z2 control)
        *   **Avg Cadence:** 170.8 spm (✅ Excellent adherence to target)
        *   **Efficiency Factor (EF): 0.01867** (✅ **Breakthrough performance**, surpassing the 0.0180 target for the first time in a Z2 effort)
        *   **Decoupling:** 0.3% (✅ Outstanding aerobic stability within the run segments)
    *   **Conclusion:** A highly successful session that demonstrates a new level of aerobic economy and improved running mechanics (cadence). The high walk ratio was a smart tactical choice that enabled the high-quality running. The only minor improvement area was the high average walk HR (147.2 bpm), which offered limited recovery.

#### **B. Wednesday, 2025-05-28: The "NME Pre-Fatigue Synergy" Test**

*   **Run:** `20250528_172211_W22-Wed_NME2_Z2Run-Decoup15p_31CHot`
*   **Plan:** NME1 (Strength/Form Focus) with a short 5-10 min cadence run. (Note: Verbal log indicates NME2/Plyo focus was executed).
*   **Pre-Run Wellness:** "Green" light. Excellent recovery markers (HRV 150.7ms, Recovery 97%).
*   **Analysis:** This session provided a crucial, quantifiable insight into synergy. The athlete performed drills and plyometrics (RPEs 6-8) *before* the Z2 run segment.
    *   **KPIs (Run Segment - 24.0 min):**
        *   **Avg HR:** 149.3 bpm (✅ Perfect Z2 control)
        *   **Avg Cadence:** 165.1 spm (✅ Good adherence to target)
        *   **Efficiency Factor (EF):** 0.01658 (❌ Below target, and significantly lower than Tuesday's run)
        *   **Decoupling: 14.96%** (❌ **CRITICAL FINDING.** Extremely high decoupling)
    *   **Conclusion:** The high decoupling, despite excellent HR control, demonstrates the significant **neuromuscular fatigue** induced by the preceding NME work. This pre-fatigue increased the cardiovascular cost of the run, providing a clear measure of the "cost" of this specific session structure. The run was an excellent test of running on tired legs, a key adaptation stimulus.

#### **C. Saturday, 2025-05-31: The "High-Risk, High-Reward" Threshold Breakthrough**

*   **Run:** `20250531_155252_W22Sat_LongThreshold_AvgHR178_Decoup2p_OnLowSleep_Hot32C_EF0183_Cad167`
*   **Plan:** 80-90 min Aerobic Long Run, HR mostly Z1/low Z2 (<155bpm).
*   **Pre-Run Wellness:** ❤️ **Red Light.** Critically low sleep **(4.2 hours)**, low sleep score (60%), and "Yellow" recovery score (75%). Although HRV and RHR were excellent, the acute sleep deprivation should have triggered a "REST" day according to the G/A/R protocol.
*   **Analysis:** This session was a **massive deviation from the plan and safety protocols**, executed as a prolonged, high-intensity threshold run in extreme heat (32.3°C).
    *   **KPIs (Run-Only Segment - 84.1 min):**
        *   **Avg HR: 177.5 bpm** (❌ Firmly in Zone 4, not Z2)
        *   **Pace:** 5:08/km (8:15/mile)
        *   **Efficiency Factor (EF): 0.0183** (✅ Excellent for this intensity)
        *   **Decoupling: 1.79%** (✅ **Stunning.** An exceptionally low value for an 84-minute run at threshold in extreme heat on no sleep. This points to elite-level cardiovascular durability.)
        *   **Cadence:** 166.7 spm (⚠️ Good, just shy of the 167-172 target)
    *   **Conclusion:** A physiologically remarkable performance that establishes a new, very high benchmark for threshold endurance. However, it represents a complete protocol breach. The low decoupling is the standout metric, indicating an immense aerobic capacity is supporting the high-intensity effort with minimal cardiovascular drift, even under multiple severe stressors.

### **III. Synthesized Weekly Learnings & Updated Physiological Model**

1.  **New Aerobic Efficiency Baseline:** The athlete's true Z2 running economy (in moderate conditions, when fresh) is now demonstrably at or above an EF of **0.0185**. This is a significant improvement.
2.  **Threshold Durability is a Major Strength:** The ability to hold Z4 HR for ~84 minutes with <2% decoupling, even under multiple stressors, is a new, defining characteristic of the runner's physiological profile. The lactate threshold is not only high but also highly durable.
3.  **NME Work has a High Immediate "Cost":** Performing NME work directly before a run significantly increases cardiovascular strain (high decoupling) for that run. This cost can now be roughly quantified (~15% decoupling). This is valuable for planning training sequences.
4.  **Protocol Adherence is a Key Limiter:** The primary risk to sustainable progress is now clearly the athlete's tendency to override wellness protocols and planned session intent. While the outcomes can be spectacular, the practice is high-risk for burnout, maladaptation, or injury.

### **IV. Action Plan & Recommendations for Week 23**

The primary objective for Week 23 is recommended to be **RECOVERY & ADAPTATION** from the massive effort on Saturday.

1.  **Immediate Recovery (First 2-3 Days of Wk23):**
    *   **Action:** Schedule **Full Rest** or very light **Active Recovery** (e.g., 20-30 min Z1 walk) only. No running, no NME, no intensity.
    *   **Rationale:** To allow for full physiological and neurological recovery from the high-stress, low-sleep Wk22 Saturday run. Monitor wellness markers closely for a return to a stable "Green" state.

2.  **Protocol Adherence & G/A/R System:**
    *   **Action:** Conduct a "post-mortem" on the decision to run hard on Saturday. Reinforce the G/A/R system rules in the `operational_playbook.md`. A Red Light day must be respected.
    *   **Rationale:** To prevent unsustainable training patterns that could lead to a crash.

3.  **Update Benchmarks:**
    *   **Action:** Log the Saturday run as a new **Threshold Endurance Benchmark**. Use the pace (~5:08/km or ~8:15/mile) and HR (177.5bpm) data to update `zones_personal.yml` with a validated Z4 pace.
    *   **Rationale:** To ensure future training plans are based on the latest, most accurate performance data.

This was a landmark week for demonstrating a new level of performance capacity. The challenge now is to integrate this new potential into the systematic, sustainable framework of the Cultivation project. The focus for Week 23 must be on recovery to ensure these gains can be built upon safely.
