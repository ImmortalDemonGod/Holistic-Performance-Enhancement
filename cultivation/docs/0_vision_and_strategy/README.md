# 0 Vision and Strategy Overview

This section houses the foundational vision, philosophy, and high-level strategic direction for the Cultivation (Holistic Performance Enhancement) project. It contains:

- **Canonical Vision & Philosophy**
  - [`The_Dao_of_Cultivation_A_Founding_Vision.md`](The_Dao_of_Cultivation_A_Founding_Vision.md): The primary philosophical and motivational document, articulating the project's deep "why," core values, and the unity of knowledge and action.
  - [`project_philosophy_and_core_concepts.md`](project_philosophy_and_core_concepts.md): Defines the project's mission, ultimate goals, and the principle that "if a benefit isn’t measured, it effectively isn’t real." Details the initial domains (Running, Biological Knowledge, Software Engineering), the holistic, data-driven approach, and the operationalization of synergy and potential.

- **Strategic Initiatives**
  - [`strategic_initiatives/CULTIVATION_SVEP_MASTER_V1_0.md`](strategic_initiatives/CULTIVATION_SVEP_MASTER_V1_0.md): The Systematic Visibility & Engagement Plan (SVEP) — a comprehensive strategy for increasing project visibility, fostering engagement, and integrating outreach with core development workflows.

- **Archive**
  - [`archive/`](archive/): Superseded or historical strategic documents, including deep dives on synergy, critiques, final thoughts, and market/system mapping. Useful for tracing the evolution of project thinking.
    - `critique_and_refinement.md`: Evolution of the synergy concept and the demand for quantification.
    - `final_thoughts.md`: Reflections on domain selection, synergy, and alignment with ultimate goals.
    - `synergy_concept.md`: Early attempts to define holistic potential and cross-domain synergy.
    - `systems_map_and_market_cheatsheet.md`: Strategic dashboard for project assets, flows, and external opportunities.
    - `potential_overview.md`, `ultimate_goals.md`: Additional context on project ambition and aims.
