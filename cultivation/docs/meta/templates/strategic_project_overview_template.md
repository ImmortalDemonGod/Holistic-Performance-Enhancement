## 1. Executive Summary & Vision
<!-- What is this project about? What problem does it solve or opportunity does it pursue? What is the long-term vision if successful? (1-2 paragraphs) -->

## 2. Core Problem / Opportunity
<!-- Detailed description of the problem being addressed or the opportunity being seized. Include context and significance. -->

## 3. Proposed Solution & Unique Value Proposition
<!-- How will this project address the problem/opportunity? What makes this solution unique or compelling? -->

## 4. Target Audience / Key Stakeholders
<!-- Who is this project for? Who are the primary beneficiaries or users? Who are other key stakeholders? -->

## 5. High-Level System Architecture / Components
<!-- 
Use a Mermaid diagram (or similar) for a C4 Level 1 style context diagram, or a list of key components and their interactions.
Focus on Inputs -> Key Processes/Components -> Outputs.
-->
```mermaid

    B --> E[Output/Deliverable 2];
```

## 6. Strategic Roadmap & Key Milestones
<!-- 
High-level phased roadmap. Use a table for clarity.
Phase | Duration Estimate | Key Objectives | Major Deliverables | Success Metrics for Phase
-->
| Phase        | Duration Est. | Key Objectives                                  | Major Deliverables                          | Success Metrics                     |
| :----------- | :------------ | :---------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------ | :---------------------------------- |
| Phase 0: Concept & Planning | [e.g., 1 Month] | [Define scope, initial design, resource plan] | [This document, initial PoC plan]         | [Scope approved, PoC funded]      |
| Phase 1: MVP Development    | [e.g., 3 Months]| [Build core functional MVP]                     | [Working MVP, initial user feedback]      | [MVP meets X criteria]            |
| ...          |               |                                                 |                                             |                                     |

### 6.1 Critical Go/No-Go Decision Gates
<!-- What are the key points where a decision will be made to continue, pivot, or halt the project? -->
1.  **Gate 1 (End of Phase X):** Criteria: [e.g., Technical feasibility proven, Market interest validated > Y%]. Decision: Proceed to Phase Y / Pivot / Halt.
2.  ...
