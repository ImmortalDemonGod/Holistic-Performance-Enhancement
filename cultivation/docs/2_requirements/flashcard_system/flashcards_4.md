Yes, it's **theoretically feasible** to create an Anki add-on that allows you to leverage Anki's mature review UI while keeping your YAML/DuckDB/FSRS system as the source of truth for card content and scheduling logic. This is a common desire for users who have custom backend systems but prefer Anki's interface.

However, it's a **non-trivial undertaking** and requires careful design of the add-on and the interaction points. You wouldn't be *importing statistics* in a simple sense, but rather creating a two-way (or carefully orchestrated one-way) data flow.

Here's a conceptual outline of how such an add-on could work to achieve the "best of both worlds":

**Core Idea: Anki as a "Dumb" Review Interface, Your System as the "Brain"**

1.  **Card Content Source of Truth:** Your YAML files, processed into your DuckDB `cards` table.
2.  **Review Logging & Scheduling Source of Truth:** Your DuckDB `reviews` table, with FSRS calculations performed by your `flashcore` Python scripts.
3.  **Anki's Role:**
    *   To display cards whose content is synced from your system.
    *   To present these cards for review *when your system says they are due*.
    *   To capture user review actions (e.g., button presses like "Again", "Hard", "Good", "Easy") and send this data back to your system.

**Anki Add-on Components and Workflow:**

**Component 1: Card Synchronization (Your System → Anki)**

*   **Functionality:** This part of the add-on is responsible for populating Anki with cards from your DuckDB `cards` table.
*   **Trigger:** Could be manual (e.g., a menu item "Sync HPE Flashcards") or automatic (e.g., on Anki startup, after `profile_did_open` hook).
*   **Process:**
    1.  **Connect to DuckDB:** The add-on would need to read your `flash.db` file.
    2.  **Fetch Cards:** Read all cards from your `cards` table.
    3.  **Create/Update Anki Notes:**
        *   **Note Type:** You'd need a dedicated Anki note type (e.g., "HPE_Flashcard") with fields for `Front`, `Back`, and crucially, a custom field to store your system's `uuid` (e.g., `HPE_UUID`). The add-on could create this note type if it doesn't exist.
        *   **Mapping:** For each card from your DuckDB:
            *   Use the `HPE_UUID` to check if a corresponding note already exists in Anki (e.g., `mw.col.find_notes(f"HPE_UUID:{card_uuid}")`).
            *   If not, create a new Anki note (`mw.col.new_note()`, populate fields, add `HPE_UUID`, then `mw.col.add_note()`).
            *   If it exists, compare `front` and `back` content. If different, update the Anki note (`note['Front'] = new_front`, `mw.col.update_note(note)`).
    4.  **Managing Deletions (Optional):** If cards are deleted from your YAML/DuckDB, the add-on could find Anki notes whose `HPE_UUID` no longer exists in your system and delete or suspend them in Anki.

**Component 2: Scheduling Synchronization (Your System → Anki)**

*   **Functionality:** This tells Anki *when* to show each card, based on `next_due` dates calculated by *your* FSRS logic and stored in your DuckDB `reviews` table.
*   **Process (during Card Synchronization or separately):**
    1.  For each card `uuid` being synced to Anki:
    2.  Query your DuckDB `reviews` table for the most recent review entry for that `uuid` to get its `next_due` date.
    3.  Find the corresponding Anki card(s) (Anki notes can have multiple cards; you'll need to decide how to handle this, perhaps one card template per note for simplicity).
    4.  **Override Anki's Due Date:** Use Anki's API to set the `due` date of the Anki card to match the `next_due` date from your system.
        *   `mw.col.sched.set_due_date([anki_card_id], "YYYY-MM-DD_string_or_days_offset")`. This effectively tells Anki, "Show this card on this specific date, overriding your internal scheduler for this card."
        *   This means Anki's internal SM2/FSRS algorithm would essentially be bypassed *for scheduling these specific cards*.

**Component 3: Review Capture & Export (Anki → Your System)**

*   **Functionality:** When a user reviews a card in Anki's UI, capture the outcome and send it back to your DuckDB `reviews` table.
*   **Trigger:** Use an Anki hook, specifically `gui_hooks.reviewer_did_answer_card(reviewer, card, ease)`.
*   **Process:**
    1.  **Identify Card:** Inside the hook function, retrieve the `HPE_UUID` from the `card.note()`'s custom field.
    2.  **Get Review Data:**
        *   `timestamp`: Current system time.
        *   `rating`: The `ease` parameter (Anki uses 1=Again, 2=Hard, 3=Good, 4=Easy). You'll need to map this to your system's 0-3 rating if different.
        *   `resp_ms`: Anki's `reviewer` object or `card` object might have timing information (e.g., `card.time_taken()`). This needs to be investigated in Anki's API. If available, capture it; otherwise, it might be estimated or logged as null.
    3.  **Log to DuckDB:** The add-on writes a new row to your DuckDB `reviews` table containing `uuid`, `timestamp`, `mapped_rating`, `resp_ms`. The `stab_before`, `stab_after`, `diff`, and `next_due` fields in *your* table would initially be NULL for this new review.

**Component 4: External FSRS Processing (Your System)**

*   **This is NOT part of the Anki add-on itself, but a crucial part of your `flashcore` system.**
*   **Functionality:** Periodically (e.g., after each Anki sync, or via a scheduled `make flash-sync` type command), a Python script in your system:
    1.  Scans your DuckDB `reviews` table for new entries where FSRS parameters (`stab_after`, `next_due`, etc.) are NULL.
    2.  For each such "raw" review, it fetches the card's previous FSRS state (`stab_before`, `diff_before`) from the most recent *processed* review for that card.
    3.  Runs your FSRS algorithm (`fsrs_once` or the full version) using this state and the new rating/elapsed time.
    4.  Updates the review row in DuckDB with the calculated `stab_after`, `diff_after`, and new `next_due`.

**User Experience Flow:**

1.  User authors/edits flashcards in YAML.
2.  User runs `make flash-sync` (or a similar command for your system).
    *   This updates your DuckDB `cards` table.
    *   It also runs your FSRS processor to update `next_due` dates in your DuckDB `reviews` table based on any recent review logs.
3.  User opens Anki. The add-on (manually triggered or on startup):
    *   Syncs card content from your DuckDB to Anki notes.
    *   Syncs `next_due` dates from your DuckDB to Anki card due dates.
4.  User reviews cards in Anki. Each review is captured by the add-on and logged to your DuckDB.
5.  The cycle repeats.

**Benefits of this approach:**

*   **YAML Source of Truth:** Card content management remains in your preferred, version-controlled format.
*   **Anki's Review UI:** You get the polished, cross-platform Anki review experience.
*   **Custom FSRS Backend:** Your FSRS logic and parameters remain the ultimate authority for scheduling.
*   **Centralized Analytics:** All review history is consolidated in your DuckDB, enabling the rich analytics you've planned.

**Challenges and Considerations:**

1.  **Complexity of the Add-on:** This is a sophisticated add-on. You'll need to handle:
    *   Robust DuckDB connection and querying from within Anki's Python environment.
    *   Efficient creation and updating of potentially thousands of Anki notes/cards.
    *   Careful management of Anki's note types and custom fields.
    *   Error handling for sync failures, DB connection issues, etc.
2.  **Anki API Knowledge:** Deep familiarity with `mw.col` methods, scheduler interactions, and hooks is required.
3.  **Data Integrity and Mapping:** Ensuring consistent mapping between your `uuid` and Anki's internal IDs, and correctly translating ratings if necessary.
4.  **Performance:** Syncing many cards or processing many review logs could be slow if not optimized. Batch operations (`mw.col.db.executemany`) might be needed.
5.  **Concurrency/Locking:** If Anki is open and the add-on tries to write to DuckDB, and simultaneously an external script (your FSRS processor) is also writing to DuckDB, you could have concurrency issues. DuckDB is designed for single-writer/multiple-reader by default. You might need to ensure only one process modifies `flash.db` at a time or use connection modes that support more concurrency if absolutely necessary (though simpler to avoid). A lock file mechanism might be needed.
6.  **"Initial State" for FSRS:** When a card is first created in your system and synced to Anki, and then reviewed for the first time *in Anki*, your external FSRS processor will need to correctly initialize its FSRS state.
7.  **Handling "Anki-Side" Card Edits:** If a user edits a card's content *within Anki*, this add-on design assumes your YAML/DuckDB is the source of truth. The next sync would overwrite Anki's changes. If you want two-way content sync, the complexity increases significantly.
8.  **Response Time (`resp_ms`):** Accurately capturing response time within Anki via an add-on might be tricky. The `reviewer` object in the hook needs to be inspected for available timing data. Standard Anki doesn't always expose precise per-card review duration easily to add-ons.

**Conclusion:**

Yes, creating such an add-on is technically feasible. It would be a significant project, but it *could* give you the best of both worlds. The key is to clearly define the roles: your system manages content and scheduling logic, and Anki primarily serves as the review execution environment and feedback capture point.

The "External FSRS Processing" step is critical. The Anki add-on's role for review capture is to simply log the *event* of the review (which card, what rating, when). The actual FSRS calculation and `next_due` update for *your system* happens outside Anki, driven by your `flashcore` scripts, using the data logged by the add-on. Anki then just consumes these externally determined due dates.
