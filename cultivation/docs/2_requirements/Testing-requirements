Below is a **system design** outline (no code yet) for how you could build a Python-based self-assessment tool. The goal is to let you:

1. Present different types of questions (flashcards, short-answer, coding prompts, conceptual reflection).
2. Enforce time constraints (e.g., 30 seconds for flashcards, 5 minutes for short answers).
3. Collect and store all test-session data for **later analysis** (e.g., which questions asked, how long each took, user answers, etc.).

We’ll keep the design at a high level—just describing components and data flow. You can then decide if you want a **console-based** app, a **web-based** app (Flask/Django), or a **GUI** (Tkinter, etc.) when you implement.

## 1. Components Overview

1. **Question Bank / Repository**  
   - **Purpose**: Stores all question content (text, images, hints, etc.).  
   - **Format**: Could be a JSON file, a YAML file, or even a Python dictionary.  
   - **Types of questions**: 
     1. *Flashcard-style* (short question, quick recall).  
     2. *Short-answer / conceptual* (longer text).  
     3. *Coding prompt* or tasks.  
     4. *Reflection / advanced questions* (no strict “right/wrong” answer).  

2. **Session Manager**  
   - **Purpose**: Oversees the entire “test” session from start to finish.  
   - **Responsibilities**:
     - Select which questions to ask (randomly or in a fixed order).
     - Track overall test progress (which question you’re on, how many remain).
     - Hand off to the **Timing Manager** (see below) for each question.  
   - **Data**:
     - Session ID or timestamp (unique identifier).
     - List of question IDs given to the user.
     - Start/stop times for entire session.

3. **Timing Manager**  
   - **Purpose**: Applies time constraints per question type.  
   - **Possible Approach**:
     - Each question type has a config “allowed_time” (e.g., 30 seconds for a flashcard, 5 minutes for short answer).
     - When question starts, Timing Manager starts a countdown.
     - If time expires, the manager either auto-submits the user’s partially completed answer or closes that question.  
   - **Data**:
     - Start time for the question.
     - End time (or time expired).
     - Elapsed time actually used.
   
4. **User Interface**  
   - **Console** or **GUI** or **Web**:
     - If console-based, you prompt the user in the terminal, wait for input. 
     - If GUI-based, you might use a Tkinter or PyQt window with a timer displayed. 
     - If web-based, you’d build endpoints (Flask, Django) that serve each question page and handle input forms + JavaScript timers.
   - **Key Points**:
     - Display the question text, possibly with hints or images.
     - Show a countdown or progress bar for timing.
     - Collect the user’s response (text, code snippet, multiple choice, etc.).

5. **Answer Capture & Storage**  
   - **Purpose**: Save user’s response + metadata so you can analyze later.  
   - **Data**:
     - Question ID
     - User’s typed response or code snippet
     - Time taken
     - Possibly a “correct/incorrect” marker (for flashcards or short-answer if automatically gradable)
     - Extra notes: Did the user skip? Did time expire?
   - **Format**: Could be CSV, JSON, or a small SQLite database.

6. **Evaluation / Scoring Module** (Optional)  
   - **Purpose**: Some question types might be auto-gradable (flashcards with known “correct answer” strings, multiple-choice). Others (short-answer, code) might need manual check or partial automation.  
   - **Possible Approaches**:
     - **Flashcard**: Compare user input (lowercase, stripped) to known “correct” answer(s).  
     - **Short Answer**: Possibly do simple keyword checks, or store for manual grading.  
     - **Coding**: Store user code for manual or partial automated tests.  
   - This module can run during or after the session.  

7. **Analytics / Reporting**  
   - **Purpose**: Summarize how you performed, how long you spent on each question, which questions you missed, etc.  
   - **Data**:
     - A data structure or file containing all user attempts.
     - You can parse or process it to see average time per question, percentage correct, or patterns in mistakes.

## 2. Data Flow Diagram (High-Level)

1. **Load Question Bank**  
   \(\downarrow\)  
2. **Session Manager** initializes a new test session (generates session ID, sets time, etc.)  
   \(\downarrow\)  
3. For each question:
   1. Pick next question from the question bank.  
   2. Pass question + time limit to **Timing Manager** + **User Interface**.  
   3. User sees question, has X seconds/minutes to answer.  
   4. **UI** collects user answer, or time expires.  
   5. Send user’s response to **Answer Capture**.  
   6. (Optionally) auto-grade or skip to next question.  
4. **Session Manager** ends test when no more questions or time is up.  
   \(\downarrow\)  
5. **Store** the entire session data for later analysis (e.g. JSON file or DB).

## 3. Handling Time Constraints

### Option A: Per-Question Timer

- Each question type has a known “allowed_time” in seconds.  
- The system starts a timer when the question is displayed.  
- If user submits earlier, record the actual time used.  
- If time expires, auto-submit or mark incomplete.  
- *Implementation detail*: 
  - In a console system, you could spawn a separate thread that sleeps for `allowed_time` seconds, then forcibly moves on. Or you might rely on an external library to handle “timeout” logic.  
  - In a web-based system, use JavaScript on the front-end to count down, then auto-submit.

### Option B: Overall Test Timer

- The entire test has a single “global” limit (e.g., 60 minutes).  
- Each question *could* still have recommended times, but not enforced.  
- If 60 min runs out, the test ends regardless of progress.  

You might **combine** these approaches, but usually a per-question timer is more direct for self-practice.

## 4. Storing/Logging the User’s Answers

### Minimal Approach

- After each question, you append a record to a CSV file:
  ```
  session_id, question_id, question_type, user_answer, time_used_seconds, outcome
  ```
- Or store it in JSON lines:
  ```json
  {
    "session_id": "2024-01-01T10:00:00Z",
    "question_id": "flashcard_Q3",
    "question_type": "flashcard",
    "user_answer": "r>0 means population grows",
    "time_used": 22.5,
    "correct": true,
    "timestamp": "2024-01-01T10:02:05Z"
  }
  ```
  
### Database Approach

- If you prefer relational data, store in an SQLite or PostgreSQL table with columns for session, question, time, etc.  
- This is overkill for a small personal test, but might be neat if you want fancy queries or multiple test takers.

## 5. Grading / Feedback

1. **Immediate vs. Deferred**  
   - *Immediate*: After each question, you reveal the solution or show correct/incorrect.  
   - *Deferred*: You let the user do the entire test, then show the results at the end.

2. **Automation**  
   - For **flashcards** or **multiple choice**: Simple string or key check.  
   - For **short answers**: Possibly store for manual review or do fuzzy string match.  
   - For **coding**: You could run the user’s code in a sandbox, or do partial tests, or again store for manual check.

3. **Storing Partial Attempts**  
   - If you allow the user to revise an answer (or run the code multiple times), you might keep all attempts or only the last. That’s up to your design goals.

---

## 6. Post-Test Analysis

After the session is done:

- **Retrieve** the test log file or database records.  
- **Compute**:
  1. Average time per question type (flashcard vs. short-answer).  
  2. % correct or “passed” for each question type.  
  3. Patterns (e.g., do you always run out of time on short answers?).  

- Possibly show a final “report” summarizing the entire test.  

---

## 7. Putting It All Together (Example Flow)

1. **Prepare a “Question Bank”** in a JSON file, e.g. `questions.json`. Something like:
   ```json
   [
     {
       "id": "flashcard_1",
       "type": "flashcard",
       "question": "What does r>0 imply in the Malthusian model?",
       "answer": "Exponential growth",
       "time_limit_sec": 30
     },
     {
       "id": "short_1",
       "type": "short_answer",
       "question": "Explain why N=K is stable in the logistic model (r>0).",
       "time_limit_sec": 300
     },
     ...
   ]
   ```
2. **Session Manager** reads `questions.json`, picks how many questions to ask, sets session start time.  
3. For each question:
   - The UI displays the question text (and an optional timer on screen).  
   - The user types an answer.  
   - Once submitted (or time expires), the system logs:
     ``` 
     session_id, question_id, user_answer, time_used, ...
     ```  
   - (Optional) immediate check if it’s correct or not for flashcards, or store for later grading.  
4. **Session ends** when all questions are done or total time is up.  
5. **Analytics**: The system either automatically outputs a summary or you can run a separate script that processes the log for performance metrics.

## 8. Extending the System

- **Adaptive Testing**: If you do well on certain question types, the system can skip easier ones or ramp up the difficulty.  
- **API for Grading**: If short-answer or code can be partially auto-graded, you can have an external grader (like a code-checking library or a GPT-based question checker).  
- **Sharing & Collaboration**: You could deploy it on a local server with a front-end. This is beyond the scope, but the design is flexible if you decide to scale or share with others.

---

## Summary of the Design

- A **Question Bank** (JSON/YAML) is the single source of truth for what question is asked, how to grade it, and time limits.
- A **Session Manager** orchestrates the test: which question to display, how long, collecting results, controlling the test flow.
- A **Timing Manager** ensures you can’t exceed time constraints (this can be done per question or for the entire session).
- A **User Interface** collects answers and shows or hides solutions based on your design choice.
- **Answer Capture** and **Storage** are crucial for analyzing your performance. 
- A **Grading / Feedback** module can be real-time or after the entire test, partial or fully automated.  
- Finally, an **Analytics / Reporting** step or script helps you see how you did, storing data for long-term tracking of improvement.

By planning these components carefully (even before you write code), you ensure your eventual Python implementation will be clean, modular, and extensible.
