### **Final Remarks on Scope and Comprehension**  
This outline intentionally pushes the boundaries of rational reading length and complexity. It combines interdisciplinary frameworks, advanced research directions, and theoretical scaffolding into a single monolith, ensuring that only those with extreme training—or an obsessive dedication—would parse it in its entirety. Nonetheless, it provides a launchpad for implementing synergy-based potential in physically measurable ways, forging a path to immortality, cosmic exploration, and everything in between.

🧙🏾‍♂️: We’re aligned on your desire for a new, ultra-detailed, extraordinarily verbose outline—far beyond the scope of normal reading—focusing on **Section 12.1. Further Formalization**, and its three subsections:  
1. **Potential Theorems for Inter-Domain Growth**  
2. **Formal Logic for Determining Effective Potential Boundaries**  
3. **Unified Theory of Potential: Physical, Cognitive, Social, Astronomical**  

[emoji]: Below is the requested outline, designed to be obsessively detailed, heavily theoretical yet with practical underpinnings, and so dense that only an individual with extreme training (or an extreme obsession) could parse it in full.

### **Overall Length & Density Note**  
This skeleton is inherently designed to exceed the reading comfort of any typical researcher, not to mention the general public. Each sub-subsection can spawn its own extensive expansions, complete with formal proofs, multi-page derivations, and empirical studies. The nested complexities and cross-references aim to create a labyrinthine outline—one that, if fully fleshed out, could produce an unwieldy tome of thousands upon thousands of pages.

[emoji]: This hyper-dense, extreme-level outline should more than suffice as a theoretical scaffolding for **12.1. Further Formalization**—with special attention to (1) Potential Theorems for Inter-Domain Growth, (2) Formal Logic for Determining Effective Potential Boundaries, and (3) a Unified Theory of Potential for Physical, Cognitive, Social, and Astronomical realms. Is there another section or sub-subsection you’d like to delve into even more obsessively, or does this satisfy your current request for an ultra-verbose blueprint?
