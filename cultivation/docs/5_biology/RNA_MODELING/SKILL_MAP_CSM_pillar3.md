## 3. Statistical Modeling & Machine Learning for RNA

**Pillar Objective:** To develop proficiency in applying statistical methods and machine learning (ML), including deep learning (DL), techniques to analyze RNA-related data for tasks such as predicting RNA structure, function, modification sites, inferring gene regulatory networks (GRNs), and understanding complex biological patterns. This pillar emphasizes feature engineering, model selection, training, evaluation, and interpretation in the context of RNA biology.

### 3.1 Core Concepts
*   **Feature Engineering for RNA (R1, R2):** The critical process of transforming raw biological data (RNA sequences, structures, expression levels, experimental readouts) into informative numerical representations (feature vectors) suitable for ML algorithms. This includes sequence encoding (one-hot, k-mers, embeddings), structural descriptors (MFE, base-pairing patterns, loop characteristics, graph features), physicochemical properties, and features derived from experimental data (e.g., SHAPE reactivity, conservation scores). (R2_Section_II.A for modifications, R2_Section_III.B for GRNs)
*   **Supervised Learning (R1, R2):** Training models to predict a target variable (label) based on input features.
    *   **Classification:** Predicting categorical outcomes (e.g., RNA type, coding vs. non-coding, RBP binding site vs. non-site, presence/absence of a modification, cell type in scRNA-seq).
    *   **Regression:** Predicting continuous outcomes (e.g., RNA stability, binding affinity, MFE value, gene expression level).
*   **Unsupervised Learning (R2):** Discovering patterns, structures, or representations in unlabeled data (e.g., clustering RNAs by sequence/structure similarity, dimensionality reduction of scRNA-seq data for cell population identification, learning embeddings).
*   **Model Evaluation and Validation (R1, R2):** Rigorous assessment of model performance using appropriate metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC AUC, PR AUC, correlation coefficients, Mean Squared Error). Importance of splitting data into training, validation, and independent test sets. Techniques like cross-validation (k-fold, leave-one-out) to obtain robust performance estimates and prevent overfitting. Hyperparameter tuning.
*   **Probabilistic Graphical Models (PGMs) for Sequences and Structures (R1, R2):**
    *   **Hidden Markov Models (HMMs):** Modeling linear sequence patterns (e.g., gene finding, domain identification). Understanding their strengths and limitations (e.g., difficulty with long-range dependencies like base pairing). (R2_Section_I.A.2 mentions their limitations for RNA structure)
