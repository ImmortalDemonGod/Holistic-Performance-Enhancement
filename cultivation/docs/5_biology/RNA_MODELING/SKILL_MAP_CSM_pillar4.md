## 4. Wet-Lab Molecular Biology Knowledge (RNA Biology Fundamentals)

**Pillar Objective:** To establish a strong conceptual understanding of the fundamental molecular biology of RNA, including its synthesis, processing, diverse functional roles, regulation, chemical modifications, and the experimental techniques used to study it. This biological context is crucial for informing computational models, interpreting their outputs, formulating meaningful biological questions, and understanding the origin and limitations of experimental data used in computational RNA biology.

### 4.1 Core Concepts
*   **The Central Dogma of Molecular Biology and Beyond (R1, R2):** Understanding the traditional flow of genetic information (DNA → RNA → Protein) and appreciating the expanding roles of RNA that extend far beyond being a simple intermediary. RNA's involvement in catalysis, gene regulation, cellular development, and differentiation. (R2_Introduction)
*   **Gene Structure and Transcription (R1, R2):**
    *   **Eukaryotic and Prokaryotic Gene Organization:** Promoters, enhancers, silencers, exons, introns, untranslated regions (UTRs).
    *   **RNA Polymerases:** Different types (Pol I, II, III in eukaryotes; bacterial RNA polymerase) and their specific roles in transcribing various classes of RNA (rRNA, mRNA/ncRNA, tRNA/5S rRNA/some ncRNAs, respectively).
    *   **Mechanism of Transcription:** Initiation (TF binding, pre-initiation complex formation), elongation (RNA chain synthesis 5'→3'), termination (terminator sequences, specific protein factors).
    *   **Co-transcriptional Processing (Eukaryotes):** 5' capping (addition of 7-methylguanosine), 3' polyadenylation (addition of poly-A tail) of pre-mRNAs. These modifications are crucial for mRNA stability, export, and translation.
*   **RNA Processing and Maturation (R1, R2):**
    *   **Splicing (Eukaryotes):** The precise removal of introns and ligation of exons from pre-mRNAs, carried out by the spliceosome (a large complex of small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs) and proteins). Understanding consensus splice sites (5' donor, 3' acceptor, branch point). (R2_RNA_Splicing)
    *   **Alternative Splicing:** A major mechanism for generating protein diversity from a single gene by differentially including or excluding exons.
    *   **tRNA and rRNA Processing:** Extensive post-transcriptional maturation involving cleavage, trimming, folding, and numerous chemical modifications to achieve functional forms.
    *   **RNA Editing (R1, R2):** Site-specific alteration of RNA sequences after transcription, leading to changes in the encoded protein or RNA function. Common types include Adenosine-to-Inosine (A-to-I) editing by ADAR enzymes (inosine is read as guanosine) and Cytidine-to-Uridine (C-to-U) editing by APOBEC enzymes. (R2_Section_II.B, R2_RNA_editing)
    *   **RNA Quality Control and Surveillance:** Cellular mechanisms that identify and degrade aberrant or non-functional RNAs (e.g., Nonsense-Mediated Decay (NMD) for mRNAs with premature stop codons, No-Go Decay, Non-Stop Decay).
*   **Diverse Classes of RNA and Their Functions (R1, R2):** (R2_Section_IV.B references Rfam (R2_58) and RNAcentral (R2_65) for comprehensive ncRNA information)
    *   **Messenger RNA (mRNA):** Carries genetic information from DNA to ribosomes to direct protein synthesis.
    *   **Transfer RNA (tRNA):** Adaptor molecules that recognize mRNA codons and deliver the corresponding amino acids to the ribosome during translation. Characterized by their cloverleaf secondary structure and L-shaped tertiary structure, and are heavily modified.
    *   **Ribosomal RNA (rRNA):** The main structural and catalytic components of ribosomes, the machinery for protein synthesis. rRNA itself possesses peptidyl transferase activity (a ribozyme).
    *   **Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs):** A vast and diverse group of RNAs that do not encode proteins but have critical regulatory, structural, or catalytic functions.
        *   **MicroRNAs (miRNAs):** Small (~20-22 nt) ncRNAs that regulate gene expression post-transcriptionally, typically by binding to the 3' UTR of target mRNAs, leading to mRNA degradation or translational repression. Processed from pri-miRNA hairpins by Drosha and Dicer, and function within the RNA-Induced Silencing Complex (RISC). (R2_Targeting_miR-155)
        *   **Small Interfering RNAs (siRNAs):** Small (~21 nt) double-stranded RNAs that mediate sequence-specific cleavage of target mRNAs through the RNA interference (RNAi) pathway. Often derived from exogenous dsRNA (e.g., viral, experimental) or endogenous sources. (R2_Molecular_Therapy)
        *   **Long Non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs):** Transcripts >200 nt with no apparent protein-coding potential. Exhibit highly diverse mechanisms and functions, including acting as molecular scaffolds, guides for chromatin-modifying complexes, decoys for proteins or miRNAs, enhancers, and regulators of transcription, splicing, and translation (e.g., XIST, HOTAIR, lincRNA-p21). (R2_ViennaRNA_Package_2.0)
        *   **Small Nuclear RNAs (snRNAs):** Components of the spliceosome (e.g., U1, U2, U4, U5, U6 snRNAs), involved in pre-mRNA splicing.
        *   **Small Nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs):** Primarily guide chemical modifications (2'-O-methylation and pseudouridylation) of rRNAs, tRNAs, and snRNAs within the nucleolus. Two main classes: C/D box snoRNAs (guide methylation) and H/ACA box snoRNAs (guide pseudouridylation).
        *   **PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs):** Small ncRNAs (24-30 nt) that associate with PIWI proteins and play a crucial role in silencing transposable elements in the germline, maintaining genome integrity.
        *   **Circular RNAs (circRNAs):** Covalently closed single-stranded RNA molecules formed by back-splicing. Implicated in various regulatory roles, including acting as miRNA sponges, RBP sponges, or regulators of transcription/splicing.
*   **Catalytic RNAs (Ribozymes) (R1, R2):** RNA molecules that possess enzymatic activity, capable of catalyzing specific biochemical reactions. Their function is intrinsically linked to their precise 3D structure. Examples include self-splicing Group I and Group II introns, hammerhead ribozyme, hairpin ribozyme, HDV ribozyme, RNase P (whose RNA component is catalytic), and the peptidyl transferase center of the ribosome (rRNA). (R2_Ribozymes)
*   **RNA Modifications (Epitranscriptomics) (R1, R2):** The diverse array (>170 known types (R2_RNA_editing)) of chemical modifications that can occur on RNA bases or the ribose sugar after transcription. These modifications play critical roles in modulating RNA structure, stability, localization, decoding, and interactions with proteins and other molecules. (R2_Section_II)
    *   **Key Modifications and Their General Impact:**
        *   **N6-methyladenosine (m6A):** The most abundant internal modification in eukaryotic mRNA. Influences mRNA splicing, export, stability, translation, and structure (generally destabilizes A•U pairs, can promote local unwinding). "Writer" (e.g., METTL3/14), "reader" (e.g., YTH domain proteins), and "eraser" (e.g., FTO, ALKBH5) proteins regulate its dynamics. (R2_Section_II.B, R2_Advances_in_RNA_secondary_structure_prediction)
        *   **Pseudouridine (Ψ):** Isomerization of uridine, very common in tRNA, rRNA, snRNA, and also found in mRNA. Generally enhances RNA structural stability, base stacking, and can alter coding potential or RBP interactions. (R2_Section_II.B)
        *   **5-methylcytosine (m5C):** Methylation at C5 of cytosine, found in various RNAs, roles in tRNA stability, mRNA export, and translation.
        *   **2'-O-methylation (Nm):** Methylation at the 2'-hydroxyl group of the ribose sugar, common in rRNA, tRNA, snRNA, and mRNA cap. Affects sugar pucker, local conformation, protects against nuclease degradation, and influences interactions.
        *   **Adenosine-to-Inosine (A-to-I) RNA editing:** Conversion of adenosine to inosine by ADAR enzymes. Inosine is interpreted as guanosine by cellular machinery, leading to changes in coding sequence, splice sites, or miRNA target sites. Can be highly structurally disruptive. (R2_Section_II.B, R2_RNA_editing, R2_Advances_in_RNA_secondary_structure_prediction)

    *   How intrinsic RNA structural elements (e.g., in 5' UTRs, 3' UTRs, or within ncRNAs) can directly sense cellular signals or interact with regulatory factors to control gene expression at transcriptional, post-transcriptional, or translational levels. Examples include:
        *   **Riboswitches:** Structured RNA elements (often in bacterial mRNA leaders or eukaryotic introns) that directly bind small molecule metabolites, causing conformational changes that regulate transcription termination or translation initiation.
