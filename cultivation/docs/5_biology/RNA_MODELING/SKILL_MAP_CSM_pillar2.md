## 2. Bioinformatics & RNA Sequence Data Analysis

**Pillar Objective:** To develop the essential skills for processing, analyzing, interpreting, and managing large-scale RNA sequence data, particularly from high-throughput sequencing (HTS) technologies like bulk RNA-seq and single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq). This pillar focuses on transforming raw sequence reads into biologically meaningful information, such as gene expression levels, transcript isoforms, sequence motifs, and understanding the quality and characteristics of RNA datasets.

### 2.1 Core Concepts
*   **High-Throughput Sequencing (HTS) Data for RNA (R1, R2):** Understanding the principles of Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) as applied to RNA (RNA-seq). This includes concepts of library preparation (e.g., poly-A selection, ribosomal RNA depletion), sequencing platforms (e.g., Illumina short-read, PacBio/Oxford Nanopore long-read), and the nature of the data generated (reads, quality scores).
*   **RNA-Seq Pipelines (R1, R2):** Familiarity with standard and advanced computational workflows for processing raw sequencing reads to extract biological insights. This encompasses quality control, read preprocessing (trimming), alignment/mapping, quantification, and various downstream analyses. Understanding differences in pipelines for bulk RNA-seq versus scRNA-seq.
*   **Data Quality Control (QC) (R1, R2):** The critical importance of assessing the quality of raw sequencing data (e.g., read quality scores, adapter content, GC bias, duplication rates) and processed data (e.g., alignment rates, coverage uniformity) to ensure reliability of downstream results.
*   **Read Alignment and Mapping (R1, R2):** The process of determining the genomic or transcriptomic origin of sequenced reads. Understanding challenges specific to RNA-seq, such as aligning reads across splice junctions (introns). Differentiating between genome mapping and transcriptome mapping/pseudoalignment.
*   **Transcript Quantification (R1, R2):** Methods for estimating the abundance of transcripts or genes from mapped reads (e.g., raw counts, FPKM, RPKM, TPM). Understanding normalization strategies to account for differences in library size and gene length.

*   **Single-Cell RNA-Seq (scRNA-seq) Data Characteristics (R2):** Specific challenges associated with scRNA-seq data, including high sparsity (many zero counts or "dropouts" due to low mRNA capture efficiency), technical noise, high dimensionality, batch effects, and the need to account for biological confounders like cell cycle. (R2_Section_III.A)
*   **Database Utilization for Sequence and Annotation Data (R1, R2):** Leveraging major public bioinformatics databases (e.g., NCBI GenBank, Ensembl, UCSC Genome Browser for genomes/annotations; SRA/GEO/ArrayExpress for raw/processed HTS data; Rfam, RNAcentral for ncRNA sequences and families; PDB for structures that can be linked back to sequences) for reference information, data retrieval, and comparative analysis.
