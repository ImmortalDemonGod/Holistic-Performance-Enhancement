Below is a drop-in replacement for the working-draft I sent earlier.
It tightens the numbers with the full strength log you pasted (July 2021 ‚Üí June 2022) and nudges the template from ‚Äúlate novice‚Äù to ‚Äúearly-intermediate‚Äù, because your history shows:
	‚Ä¢	185 lb / 84 kg pulls and 145 lb / 66 kg squats ‚áí 1 RM strength roughly body-weight √ó 1.4 (squat) and √ó 1.8 (deadlift).
That places you in the -intermediate band on most tables (e.g. ExRx).
	‚Ä¢	Weekly set exposure that occasionally spiked past 40 sets for calves and 30 sets for rows/presses ‚áí you‚Äôve tolerated, if not benefited from, quite a lot of volume.
	‚Ä¢	1‚Äì2 min rest, high-rep calf raises and leg-curl marathons dominate ‚Üí plenty of metabolic work, not much heavy axial loading.

1 ¬∑ What the old log tells us  (TL;DR)

Pattern	Avg sets¬∑wk‚Åª¬π	Peak sets¬∑wk‚Åª¬π	Load bias	Obvious gap / risk
Squat-quad	14	26	65‚Äì145 lb, mostly high-rep	Little work > 70 % 1 RM
Hip-hinge	9	14	DB/plate RDLs ‚â§ 50 lb	Very few heavy pulls; lumbar fatigue in notes
Horizontal press	13	25	Push-ups & 65‚Äì95 lb bench	Pec/shoulder niggles at > 20 sets
Horizontal pull	12	35	12.5‚Äì33 lb rows	Good balance w/ press but light
Vertical press	8	28	OHP 25‚Äì35 lb, DB Arnold	Mostly metabolic, not strength-oriented
Vertical pull	9	25	Band / 95‚Äì155 lb lat-pulldown	Almost no free-pulling (pull-ups)
Calves	22	60	100‚Äì185 lb raises	Achilles & plantar fascia at risk
Core / brace	10	18	Crunch / raises	Very little heavy anti-extension

Frequency: workouts 3.1 √ó wk‚Åª¬π on average.
Training age: comfortably early-intermediate ‚Üí you can progress load or volume, but not both every week.

Run it weekly to prove you‚Äôre living inside MAV.

‚∏ª

7 ¬∑ How to slot this into the repo
	1.	docs/3_design/strength_block.md ‚Üí replace with this file.
	2.	training_plans/2025_Q2_strength.csv ‚Üí generate from the three tables (one row per lift).
	3.	Add a CI step check_strength_volume.yml that calls strength_audit.py and fails if any muscle group < MEV or > MRV for the week.

‚∏ª

Bottom line

Your 2021-22 numbers show you can soak up ~15 good sets per muscle and handle 3 lifting days each week.
The block above preserves that volume, raises the average load, reins-in the calf abuse, and gives the posterior chain the love it‚Äôs been missing.

Paste the markdown, commit the CSV, and Friday strength is now fully integrated with the rest of your self-coaching pipeline. Enjoy the gains!
===
Here‚Äôs a plug-and-play ‚Äúno-gym‚Äù version of the Friday Hypertrophy Day.
It keeps the same movement patterns and weekly set targets, so you can swap it in without breaking the volume audit or the CI checks.

	2.	Mechanical-drop sets: e.g. do deficit push-ups ‚Üí flat push-ups ‚Üí knee push-ups without rest to extend the set.
	3.	Density bump: keep total work the same but shrink rest each week (90 ‚Üí 75 ‚Üí 60 s) until you can add resistance again.

‚∏ª

Audit hook (strength_audit.py) ‚Äî no change needed ‚úÖ

Because we still log pattern, sets, and date, the weekly summary script will count these sets exactly like the barbell day.

‚∏ª

When you do get back to the gym
	‚Ä¢	Run the normal Friday program the following week.
	‚Ä¢	Treat the band day as equal volume (no ‚Äúmake-up‚Äù needed).
	‚Ä¢	If DOMS was lower than usual, feel free to add +5 lb or +1 rep on the first compound lift the next gym session.

‚∏ª

Pocket recap

No gym?
‚Ä¢ Split-squat, single-leg thrust, rows under a table, loaded push-ups, face-pulls, rollouts, tempo calf raises.
‚Ä¢ Keep the same set counts, chase RPE 7-8, progress via bands/backpack/tempo.
Your volume KPIs stay green and the Base-Ox running plan never feels the difference.

Starting Calisthenics: A Weekly Workout Guide
Okay, I understand you're looking for an updated and improved calisthenics routine specifically tailored for a beginner, building upon your initial draft and incorporating the advice from the sources and our previous discussion. Your original routine was a good start, focusing on fundamental movements and emphasizing form [User Query], which aligns with the principles outlined in the sources. However, the sources provide a more structured and comprehensive approach for beginners to build a strong foundation and progress effectively.

Based on the sources, a beginner's journey in calisthenics starts with mastering the fundamentals and building "strong Foundation" in Push, Pull, and Squat strength. Level 1 in the sources' pyramid is dedicated to this, covering exercises like basic support holds, hanging, bodyweight squats and lunges, incline push-ups, and incline body rows. They also strongly emphasize the importance of scapular awareness and wrist strengthening/mobility as crucial pre-workout preparation to avoid injury and ensure proper form.

Instead of a 2-day full-body split, the sources suggest a more frequent training schedule for significant progress. Their recommended weekly structure for beginners is a 6-day training week followed by a rest day. This allows for dedicated focus on different movement patterns and crucial elements like mobility and cardio.

Here is an updated routine structured according to the principles and weekly layout suggested by the sources, incorporating beginner-appropriate exercises and essential preparation:

**Core Principles of This Routine (Based on Sources):**

*   **Master the Fundamentals:** Focus on proper form and control in foundational exercises before attempting harder variations or skills.
*   **Build a Strong Foundation:** Develop basic Push, Pull, and Squat strength consistently.
*   **Prioritize Preparation:** Include mobility, joint preparation (especially scapula and wrists), and warm-up before each session.
*   **Consistency is Key:** Follow a structured weekly plan for at least 3 months to see significant changes.
*   **Listen to Your Body:** Progress gradually and don't push through pain.

**Updated Beginner Calisthenics Weekly Routine (Example Based on Sources):**

This routine follows the sources' suggested 6-day structure. Remember, the sources recommend starting with core and joint prep and a dynamic warm-up before the strength training on each day.

**Daily Pre-Workout Prep (Before each training day):**

*   **Wrist Stretching/Mobility:** Perform wrist stretches like rocking forward into hands (arms locked). *Perform daily before any workout*.
*   **Scapular Awareness & Core/Joint Prep:** Select 2-3 exercises from this list each day, focusing on control:
    *   Scapular Push-ups (on knees if needed, arms locked, push shoulder blades away/let them touch). Focus on retraction and protraction.
    *   Scapular Pull-ups (from dead hang, depress scapula). Practice scapular depression.
    *   Cat and Cow Pose (focus on spine/lower back mobility).
    *   Bird Dog Pose (open core, lower back activation).
    *   Hollow Body Hold (lower back pressed to ground, anti-extension). Hold for suggested time or fatigue.
    *   Side Plank (2 sets per side, 30+ seconds suggested, squeeze obliques, reach out).

*   **Dynamic Warm-up:** Aim for a gentle sweat. Avoid static stretching before training. Choose 2-3 dynamic exercises:
    *   Skipping in place or High Knees.
    *   Plank Walks (work scapular protraction and pushing muscles).
    *   Arm circles, leg swings, torso twists.
    *   *Alternatively, use a cardio machine like an exercise bike for a set number of minutes (e.g., 5-10 min)*.

**Monday: Push Day**

After your Daily Pre-Workout Prep & Warm-up:

*   **Pseudo Planche Lean:** (Prerequisite for planche) Start with hands slightly outward, straight arms, pressure on front 3 fingers, lean forward. Focus on feeling pressure on the front delt.
    *   *Sets & Duration:* (Sources don't specify sets/reps for this beginner exercise, but a common approach is 2-3 sets holding for time, e.g., 15-30 seconds)
*   **Push-ups (Progression):** Start with the easiest variation you can do with good form.
    *   *Option 1 (Absolute Beginner):* Wall Push-ups (easier, practice form).
    *   *Option 2 (Beginner):* Incline Push-ups (high or low incline).
    *   *Option 3 (Progressing):* Standard Push-ups (aim for 18-25 in a row before advancing). Keep elbows tucked (at least 45¬∞), fully protract scapula at the top.
    *   *Sets & Reps:* 2-3 sets, AMRAP (As Many Reps As Possible with good form) [User Query] or aim for a target number that challenges you (e.g., 8-15 reps depending on the variation).
*   **Dips (Progression):** Start with the easiest variation.
    *   *Option 1 (Beginner):* Bent Leg Dips (can use a wall, parallel bars, rings, straight bar). Keep chest up, arms to 90¬∞. Aim for 15 reps before straightening legs.
    *   *Option 2 (Progressing):* Straight Leg Dips.
    *   *Sets & Reps:* 2-3 sets, aim for 7-12 reps depending on the variation and your level. Focus on controlled movement.
*   **Pike Push-ups:** (Similar to military press) Start in a pike position, flex core/legs, head goes above hands on decline, push up/out through scapula, elbows tucked.
    *   *Sets & Reps:* 2-3 sets, aim for 5-10 reps.
*   **Diamond Push-ups:** (Increases triceps/chest activity) Standard push-up procedure but hands in a diamond position. Protract scapula at top.
    *   *Sets & Reps:* 2-3 sets, aim for 6-12 reps.
*   **Wall Handstand:** (Learn to be inverted) Back to wall or chest to wall, toes pointed, flex core, arms locked out. Don't forget to breathe.

*   **Pull-ups (Progression):**
    *   *Option 1 (Building towards first):* Band Assisted Pull-ups (band helps alleviate weight). Pause at the bottom to solidify movement.
    *   *Option 2 (Achieved first):* Standard Pull-ups (aim for 3 sets of 5 reps). Pull to lower chest, retract scapula.
    *   *Sets & Reps:* 2-3 sets, aim for targeted reps or AMRAP with good form. Being able to do a standard pull-up is a testament to true strength.
*   **Bodyweight Curls:** (For biceps) Use a bar, rings, or table edge. Curl until nose or temples touch the bar.
    *   *Sets & Reps:* 2-3 sets, aim for 8-15 reps.

    *   *Sets & Duration:* 3 sets of 60 seconds suggested. Keep a 90¬∞ angle.
*   **Hollow Body Hold:** (End with anti-extension work).
    *   *Sets & Duration:* 2-3 sets, hold as long as possible.

**Sunday: Rest Day**

Your muscles need time to repair and recover.

**How This Routine Improves on Your Original:**

1.  **Increased Frequency & Dedicated Focus:** The sources' 6-day split allows for more training volume throughout the week compared to 2 days, giving dedicated time to Push, Pull, and Legs, while also including essential Mobility and Cardio.
2.  **Comprehensive Preparation:** Explicitly includes daily wrist stretches and incorporates crucial scapular awareness exercises and other joint prep into the warm-up phase. This is vital for injury prevention and mastering calisthenics skills later.
3.  **Structured Progression Within Exercises:** The sources provide benchmarks (e.g., 18-25 push-ups/squats, 15 bent leg dips, 12 standard dips, 20 static lunges/side). This routine uses the exercises they suggest for building the foundation, implying progression through variations (wall -> incline -> standard push-ups; bent leg -> straight leg -> assisted -> standard dips/rows) as strength increases, aiming for these benchmarks.
4.  **Wider Exercise Variety:** Includes more beginner-appropriate exercises recommended by the sources (e.g., Pseudo Planche Lean, Pike Push-ups, Diamond Push-ups, Hindu Push-ups mentioned on Push day in source, Bodyweight Curls, Front Lever Raise, Skin the Cat on Pull day, RDL variations, Step-ups, Reverse Lunges, Horse Stance Squat, Compact Leg Lifts, One-Legged Plank, Sissy Squats, Wall Sits on Leg day, various mobility exercises). This offers more ways to challenge your body and build balanced strength.
5.  **Inclusion of Mobility and Cardio:** Adds a dedicated day for these often-neglected but critical aspects of fitness and calisthenics.
6.  **Clear Goal Setting:** The structure aligns with the sources' concept of building a foundation over time (at least 3 months for significant changes), providing a roadmap for progression.

While your initial routine had the right idea with exercise selection and prioritizing form, this updated routine provides a more detailed, structured, and comprehensive approach for a beginner based directly on the principles and weekly plan outlined in the sources. It covers essential preparation, a wider range of beginner exercises with potential variations for progression, and includes crucial mobility and cardiovascular work for overall fitness and long-term calisthenics development.
