**Prerequisite Concepts:**
- [RNA Nucleotide Structure](../1_RNA_Nucleotide_Structure/index.md): The chemical properties of nucleotides underpin thermodynamic rules.
- [Phosphodiester Backbone](../2_Phosphodiester_Backbone/index.md): Backbone flexibility and constraints influence folding energetics.
- [RNA vs DNA Comparison](../3_RNA_vs_DNA_Comparison/index.md): Chemical differences impact thermodynamic behavior.

**Dependent Concepts / Builds Upon This Section:**
- [Energetic Contributions to RNA Stability](../5_Energetic_Contributions/index.md): Stacking, hydrogen bonding, and other energetic factors are governed by the thermodynamic principles described here.

**Comparative Concepts:**
- [RNA vs DNA Comparison](../3_RNA_vs_DNA_Comparison/index.md): Differences in folding and stability reflect underlying thermodynamic differences.

**Application/Influence:**
- [Environmental Factors](../6_Environmental_Factors/index.md): Thermodynamic stability is modulated by salt, temperature, and other environmental conditions.
