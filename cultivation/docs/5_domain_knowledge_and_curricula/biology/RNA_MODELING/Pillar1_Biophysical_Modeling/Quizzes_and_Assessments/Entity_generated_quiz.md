## 2 ¬∑ Question-Generation Workflow

1. **Triplet Parsing**

   * For each triplet `(A, R, B)`, draft a *stem* that hides either A, R, or B.
   * Example: *Triplet 29* ‚Üí ‚ÄúWhich functional group **determines** RNA‚Äôs susceptibility to alkaline hydrolysis?‚Äù
2. **Difficulty Calibration**

   * *Level-1 (Recall):* direct restatement of triplet.
   * *Level-2 (Comprehension):* rephrase relationship.
   * *Level-3 (Application/Analysis):* combine 2-3 linked triplets (e.g., 16 + 17 + 88) to ask students to trace the irreversible nature of polymerization.
3. **Randomized Distractors**

   * Distractors are drawn from sibling nodes in the list to ensure plausibility (e.g., replace ‚Äú2‚Ä≤-OH‚Äù with ‚Äú3‚Ä≤-OH‚Äù or ‚Äú5‚Ä≤-phosphate‚Äù).
4. **Validation Pass**

   * Cross-reference each finished item against the triplet numbers; highlight any still unused triplets in red.
5. **Iterative Review**

   * Use SME peer review to rate question clarity and cognitive level; revise as needed.
