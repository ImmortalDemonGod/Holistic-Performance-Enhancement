# Quiz: Energetic Contributions

**Associated Knowledge Base Section:** [`5. Energetic Contributions`](../5_Energetic_Contributions/index.md)

**Instructions:** Answer the following questions to the best of your ability without referring to your notes initially. After completing a section, check your answers and review any challenging concepts.

## Part A: Multiple Choice Questions

1.  **Q: Which interaction provides the major energetic contribution to RNA helix stability?**
    *   A) Base stacking
    *   B) Hydrogen bonding
    *   C) Van der Waals forces
    *   D) Electrostatic repulsion
    *   **Correct Answer:** [A]
    *   *Feedback/Explanation:* Base stacking interactions are the main source of helix stability.

## Part B: Short Answer Questions

1.  **Q: What is base stacking, and why is it important in RNA?**
    *   **Expected Key Points for Answer:**
        *   Base stacking refers to interactions between aromatic bases.
        *   It stabilizes the RNA helix by minimizing exposure to water.
    *   *Self-Correction/Notes:*

## Part C: Diagram Interpretation Exercises

1.  **Prompt: Examine a diagram of stacked RNA bases. Identify stacking interactions.**
    *   **Q1: Why do purines and pyrimidines stack differently?**
        *   **A1:** Purines are larger, so stacking geometry differs; both contribute to helix stability.

## Part D: Problem-Solving Scenarios

1.  **Scenario: A mutation disrupts base stacking in an RNA molecule. What is the likely effect?**
    *   **Approach/Solution Outline:**
        *   The RNA helix will be less stable; may denature more easily.
    *   *Self-Correction/Notes:*
