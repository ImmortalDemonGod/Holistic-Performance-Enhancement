# Quiz: Energetic Contributions

**Associated Knowledge Base Section:** [`5. Energetic Contributions`](../5_Energetic_Contributions/index.md)

**Instructions:** This quiz assesses your understanding of the energetic contributions to RNA structure and stability. Attempt all questions without referring to your notes. After each section, check your answers and revisit the knowledge base for any concepts you find challenging.

## Part A: Multiple Choice Questions

*Instructions: Select the best answer for each question.*

1.  **Q:** Which interaction provides the major energetic contribution to RNA helix stability?
    *   A) Base stacking
    *   B) Hydrogen bonding
    *   C) Van der Waals forces
    *   D) Electrostatic repulsion
    *   **Correct Answer:** A
    *   *Feedback/Explanation:* Base stacking interactions are the main source of helix stability.

2.  **Q:** Which base pair is generally more stable in RNA?
    *   A) AU
    *   B) GC
    *   C) AT
    *   D) GU
    *   **Correct Answer:** B

3.  **Q:** Which factor decreases base stacking interactions in RNA?
    *   A) Lower temperature
    *   B) Disruption by chemical modification
    *   C) More GC content
    *   D) Higher salt concentration
    *   **Correct Answer:** B

## Part B: Short Answer Questions

1.  **Q: What is base stacking, and why is it important in RNA?**
    *   **Expected Key Points for Answer:**
        *   Base stacking refers to interactions between aromatic bases.
        *   It stabilizes the RNA helix by minimizing exposure to water.
    *   *Self-Correction/Notes:*

## Part C: Diagram Interpretation Exercises

1.  **Prompt: Examine a diagram of stacked RNA bases. Identify stacking interactions.**
    *   **Q1: Why do purines and pyrimidines stack differently?**
        *   **A1:** Purines are larger, so stacking geometry differs; both contribute to helix stability.

## Part D: Problem-Solving Scenarios

1.  **Scenario: A mutation disrupts base stacking in an RNA molecule. What is the likely effect?**
    *   **Approach/Solution Outline:**
        *   The RNA helix will be less stable; may denature more easily.
    *   *Self-Correction/Notes:*
