## Part A: Multiple Choice Questions

*Instructions: Select the single best answer for each question.*

1.  **Q:** Which sugar is characteristic of RNA nucleotides?
    *   A) Deoxyribose
    *   B) Ribose
    *   C) Glucose
    *   D) Fructose
    *   **Correct Answer:** B
    *   *Feedback/Explanation (Optional):* Ribose is present in RNA; deoxyribose in DNA.

2.  **Q:** Which base is found in RNA but not DNA?
    *   A) Thymine
    *   B) Cytosine
    *   C) Uracil
    *   D) Guanine
    *   **Correct Answer:** C
    *   *Feedback/Explanation (Optional):* Uracil is unique to RNA; thymine to DNA.

3.  **Q:** Which of the following is NOT a component of an RNA nucleotide?
    *   A) Phosphate group
    *   B) Deoxyribose sugar
    *   C) Ribose sugar
    *   D) Nitrogenous base
    *   **Correct Answer:** B
    *   *Feedback/Explanation (Optional):* RNA contains ribose, not deoxyribose.

## Part B: Short Answer Questions

*Instructions: Provide concise answers (typically 1-3 sentences) for each question. Focus on demonstrating your understanding of key concepts.*

1.  **Q:** List the three components of an RNA nucleotide and briefly describe the function of each.
    *   **Expected Key Points for Answer:**
        *   Ribose sugar: backbone structure
        *   Nitrogenous base: encodes genetic information
        *   Phosphate group: links nucleotides together
    *   *Self-Correction/Notes:*
        >

2.  **Q:** What is the key structural difference at the 2' carbon position between ribose (in RNA) and deoxyribose (in DNA), and what is one functional implication of this difference?
    *   **Expected Key Points for Answer:**
        *   Ribose has a hydroxyl (-OH) at 2'; deoxyribose has H
        *   The 2'-OH makes RNA more reactive and enables catalytic activity
    *   *Self-Correction/Notes:*
        >

3.  **Q:** Briefly define a "nucleoside" and a "nucleotide."
    *   **Expected Key Points for Answer:**
        *   Nucleoside = base + sugar
        *   Nucleotide = nucleoside + phosphate group(s)
    *   *Self-Correction/Notes:*
        >

## Part C: Diagram Interpretation Exercises

*Instructions: Analyze the provided diagram(s) (or sketch one if prompted) and answer the related questions. Pay attention to labels and relationships depicted.*

1.  **Prompt:** Sketch a generic RNA nucleotide. Clearly label the phosphate group, the ribose sugar (numbering the carbons 1' to 5'), and the position where a nitrogenous base attaches. Explicitly indicate the 2'-hydroxyl group.
    *   **Q1:** To which carbon of the ribose is the phosphate group typically attached in a nucleotide monomer forming part of an RNA chain?
        *   **A1:** 5' carbon
    *   **Q2:** To which carbon of the ribose is the nitrogenous base attached?
        *   **A2:** 1' carbon
    *   *Self-Correction/Notes:*
        >

2.  **Prompt:** Sketch a generic purine base and a generic pyrimidine base. Label the atoms involved in Watson-Crick hydrogen bonding.
    *   **Q1:** How many rings do purines have?
        *   **A1:** Two
    *   **Q2:** Which RNA bases are purines?
        *   **A2:** Adenine, Guanine
    *   *Self-Correction/Notes:*

## Part D: Problem-Solving Scenarios

*Instructions: Apply your knowledge from "RNA Nucleotide Structure" to analyze or solve the following scenario(s).*

1.  **Scenario:** You have a molecule with a ribose sugar, a phosphate group, and the base Uracil. Is this a DNA or RNA nucleotide? If you were to link it to another identical nucleotide, specify the linkage.
    *   **Question/Task:** Identify the type of nucleotide and describe the bond formed when linking to another nucleotide.
    *   **Approach/Solution Outline (for self-check):**
        *   RNA nucleotide (contains ribose and uracil)
        *   Linkage is a phosphodiester bond between 3' and 5' carbons
    *   *Self-Correction/Notes:*
        >

2.  **Scenario:** A mutation changes the 2'-OH group of ribose to H in an RNA molecule. Predict the likely effect on the molecule's properties.
    *   **Question/Task:** What property is lost or changed?
    *   **Approach/Solution Outline:**
        *   Molecule becomes more DNA-like; loses catalytic potential; becomes more stable
    *   *Self-Correction/Notes:*

> **Self-Assessment Guide:**
> - Review your answers critically against the "Correct Answer" or "Expected Key Points".
> - For any incorrect answers or areas where you felt unsure, revisit the [`1. RNA Nucleotide Structure`](../1_RNA_Nucleotide_Structure/index.md) knowledge base section.
> - Consider creating flashcards for any definitions, principles, or problem-solving steps you found difficult.
> - Once you have reviewed and feel confident, update the `status` in this file's frontmatter (e.g., from `stub` to `draft` or `complete` if you've filled in actual questions).
