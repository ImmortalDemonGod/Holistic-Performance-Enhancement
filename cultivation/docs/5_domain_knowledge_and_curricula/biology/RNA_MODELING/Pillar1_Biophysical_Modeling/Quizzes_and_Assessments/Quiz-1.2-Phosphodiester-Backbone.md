# Quiz: Phosphodiester Backbone

**Associated Knowledge Base Section:** [`2. Phosphodiester Backbone`](../2_Phosphodiester_Backbone/index.md)

**Instructions:** Answer the following questions to the best of your ability without referring to your notes initially. After completing a section, check your answers and review any challenging concepts.

## Part A: Multiple Choice Questions

1.  **Q: What type of bond links the 3' carbon of one ribose to the 5' carbon of the next in RNA?**
    *   A) Hydrogen bond
    *   B) Phosphodiester bond
    *   C) Peptide bond
    *   D) Glycosidic bond
    *   **Correct Answer:** [B]
    *   *Feedback/Explanation:* Phosphodiester bonds link nucleotides in nucleic acids.

## Part B: Short Answer Questions

1.  **Q: Why is the phosphodiester backbone negatively charged?**
    *   **Expected Key Points for Answer:**
        *   The phosphate groups carry negative charges at physiological pH.
    *   *Self-Correction/Notes:*

## Part C: Diagram Interpretation Exercises

1.  **Prompt: Examine a schematic of the RNA backbone. Label the 3' and 5' ends and indicate where the phosphodiester bonds occur.**
    *   **Q1: What functional group is present at the 5' end of an RNA strand?**
        *   **A1:** Phosphate group.

## Part D: Problem-Solving Scenarios

1.  **Scenario: A nuclease cleaves RNA at phosphodiester bonds. What is the consequence for the RNA molecule?**
    *   **Approach/Solution Outline:**
        *   The RNA will be cut into smaller fragments or nucleotides.
    *   *Self-Correction/Notes:*
