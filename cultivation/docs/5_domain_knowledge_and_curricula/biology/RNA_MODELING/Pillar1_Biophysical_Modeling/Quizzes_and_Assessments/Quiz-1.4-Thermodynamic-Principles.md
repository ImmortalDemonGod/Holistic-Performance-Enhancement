# Quiz: Thermodynamic Principles

**Associated Knowledge Base Section:** [`4. Thermodynamic Principles`](../4_Thermodynamic_Principles/index.md)

**Instructions:** Answer the following questions to the best of your ability without referring to your notes initially. After completing a section, check your answers and review any challenging concepts.

## Part A: Multiple Choice Questions

1.  **Q: What is the primary thermodynamic factor stabilizing RNA secondary structure?**
    *   A) Hydrophobic interactions
    *   B) Hydrogen bonding
    *   C) Ionic bonds
    *   D) Covalent bonds
    *   **Correct Answer:** [B]
    *   *Feedback/Explanation:* Hydrogen bonds between bases stabilize secondary structure.

## Part B: Short Answer Questions

1.  **Q: How does temperature affect RNA structure stability?**
    *   **Expected Key Points for Answer:**
        *   Higher temperature destabilizes RNA secondary structure (melting).
    *   *Self-Correction/Notes:*

## Part C: Diagram Interpretation Exercises

1.  **Prompt: Examine a melting curve for RNA. Identify the melting temperature (Tm).**
    *   **Q1: What does the melting temperature (Tm) represent?**
        *   **A1:** The temperature at which half the RNA molecules are denatured.

## Part D: Problem-Solving Scenarios

1.  **Scenario: You increase salt concentration in an RNA solution. What happens to the RNA's stability?**
    *   **Approach/Solution Outline:**
        *   Increased salt stabilizes RNA by shielding negative charges on the backbone.
    *   *Self-Correction/Notes:*
