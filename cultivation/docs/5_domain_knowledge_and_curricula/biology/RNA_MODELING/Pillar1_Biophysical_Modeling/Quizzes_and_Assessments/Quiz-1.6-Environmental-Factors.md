## Part A: Multiple Choice Questions

*Instructions: Select the best answer for each question.*

1.  **Q:** Which environmental factor most directly affects RNA folding?
    *   A) Light intensity
    *   B) Ion concentration
    *   C) Oxygen level
    *   D) Pressure
    *   **Correct Answer:** B
    *   *Feedback/Explanation:* Ions (e.g., Mg2+) stabilize RNA folding.

2.  **Q:** What is the effect of removing Mg2+ from an RNA solution?
    *   A) RNA folds more tightly
    *   B) RNA structure destabilizes
    *   C) No effect
    *   D) RNA is degraded
    *   **Correct Answer:** B

3.  **Q:** Which temperature condition is most likely to denature RNA structure?
    *   A) Low temperature
    *   B) Room temperature
    *   C) High temperature
    *   D) Freezing
    *   **Correct Answer:** C

## Part B: Short Answer Questions

1.  **Q: How does magnesium ion concentration affect RNA structure?**
    *   **Expected Key Points for Answer:**
        *   Mg2+ stabilizes RNA tertiary structure.
    *   *Self-Correction/Notes:*

## Part C: Diagram Interpretation Exercises

1.  **Prompt: Given a diagram of folded RNA, indicate where metal ions are likely to bind.**
    *   **Q1: Why are metal ions important for RNA structure?**
        *   **A1:** They neutralize negative charges and enable compact folding.

## Part D: Problem-Solving Scenarios

1.  **Scenario: You remove Mg2+ from an RNA solution. What is the likely effect on RNA structure?**
    *   **Approach/Solution Outline:**
        *   RNA structure will destabilize and may unfold.
    *   *Self-Correction/Notes:*
