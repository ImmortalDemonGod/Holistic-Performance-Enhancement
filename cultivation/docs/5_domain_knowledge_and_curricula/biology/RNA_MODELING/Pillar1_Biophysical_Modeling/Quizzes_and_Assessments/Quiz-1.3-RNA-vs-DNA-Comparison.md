# Quiz: RNA vs DNA Comparison

**Associated Knowledge Base Section:** [`3. RNA vs DNA Comparison`](../3_RNA_vs_DNA_Comparison/index.md)

**Instructions:** This quiz assesses your understanding of the similarities and differences between RNA and DNA. Attempt all questions without referring to your notes. After each section, check your answers and revisit the knowledge base for any concepts you find challenging.

## Part A: Multiple Choice Questions

*Instructions: Select the best answer for each question.*

1.  **Q:** Which base is found in RNA but not in DNA?
    *   A) Adenine
    *   B) Thymine
    *   C) Uracil
    *   D) Cytosine
    *   **Correct Answer:** C
    *   *Feedback/Explanation:* Uracil is unique to RNA; Thymine is unique to DNA.

2.  **Q:** Which sugar is present in DNA?
    *   A) Ribose
    *   B) Deoxyribose
    *   C) Glucose
    *   D) Fructose
    *   **Correct Answer:** B

3.  **Q:** Which statement best describes the typical structure of RNA compared to DNA?
    *   A) Both are double-stranded
    *   B) Both are single-stranded
    *   C) RNA is usually single-stranded, DNA is double-stranded
    *   D) RNA is more stable than DNA
    *   **Correct Answer:** C

## Part B: Short Answer Questions

1.  **Q: Name one structural difference between RNA and DNA.**
    *   **Expected Key Points for Answer:**
        *   RNA is usually single-stranded; DNA is double-stranded.
        *   RNA contains ribose; DNA contains deoxyribose.
    *   *Self-Correction/Notes:*

## Part C: Diagram Interpretation Exercises

1.  **Prompt: Compare a schematic of RNA and DNA. Identify the sugar and base differences.**
    *   **Q1: Which sugar is present in RNA?**
        *   **A1:** Ribose.

## Part D: Problem-Solving Scenarios

1.  **Scenario: You treat a sample of nucleic acid with RNase and DNase. Only RNase degrades it. What is the sample?**
    *   **Approach/Solution Outline:**
        *   The sample is RNA, as it is degraded by RNase but not DNase.
    *   *Self-Correction/Notes:*
