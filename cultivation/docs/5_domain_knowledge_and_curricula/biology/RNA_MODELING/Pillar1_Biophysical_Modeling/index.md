# Pillar 1 Foundations: RNA Biochemistry & Thermodynamics

Welcome to your personal knowledge base for RNA biophysics! This section will serve as the root for all foundational concepts, diagrams, and summaries related to RNA structure and thermodynamics.

## Overview
This pillar covers:
- RNA nucleotide structure
- The phosphodiester backbone
- RNA vs. DNA comparison
- Thermodynamic principles
- Energetic contributions to RNA stability
- Environmental factors affecting RNA

## Suggested Learning Path
For a structured understanding of RNA biophysical modeling foundations, we recommend progressing through the subsections in the following order. Each topic builds upon the previous ones, providing a coherent learning experience:

1.  **[RNA Nucleotide Structure](./1_RNA_Nucleotide_Structure/index.md):** Start with the basic building blocks.
2.  **[Phosphodiester Backbone](./2_Phosphodiester_Backbone/index.md):** Learn how these blocks connect to form the RNA polymer.
3.  **[RNA vs DNA Comparison](./3_RNA_vs_DNA_Comparison/index.md):** Understand the unique chemical nature of RNA.
4.  **[Thermodynamic Principles](./4_Thermodynamic_Principles/index.md):** Grasp the fundamental energetic rules governing RNA behavior.
5.  **[Energetic Contributions to RNA Stability](./5_Energetic_Contributions/index.md):** Delve into the specific forces that stabilize RNA structures.
6.  **[Environmental Factors](./6_Environmental_Factors/index.md):** Explore how external conditions influence RNA structure and stability.
7.  **[Quizzes and Assessments](./Quizzes_and_Assessments/index.md):** After covering the material, use the quizzes to test your understanding.
8.  **[Concept Map](./Concept_Map.md):** Visualize the relationships between all topics in Pillar 1.
