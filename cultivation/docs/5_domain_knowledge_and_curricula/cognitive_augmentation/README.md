# Cognitive Augmentation Domain Overview

**Version:** 1.0
**Date Created:** 2025-06-11
**Status:** Active

## 1. Mission & Vision

This section of the "Cultivation" project is dedicated to the **Cognitive Augmentation Domain**. Its mission is to develop and implement a systematic, measurable, and evidence-based training framework for enhancing core human cognitive faculties.

The cornerstone of this domain is the **Mentat-OS (Hybrid Cognitive Operating System)**, a comprehensive architecture designed to create a synergistic human-AI partnership. The goal is not to replace human cognition with machine-like processes, but to augment innate human strengthsâ€”such as contextual understanding, creative synthesis, and ethical judgmentâ€”with trained, computer-like skills in logic, memory, and analysis.

This domain provides the structured curriculum and practical drills required to transform the user from a standard information processor into a sophisticated "Mentat" operator, capable of leveraging both their own enhanced mind and their AI partner to achieve a superior level of performance in complex cognitive tasks.

## 2. Core Documents

This domain is defined by a set of core documents that outline its architecture, training protocols, and implementation plan.

*   **[The Mentat-OS Blueprint](./mentat_os_blueprint.md)**
    *   **Purpose:** The foundational charter for the Mentat-OS. Details the 5-layer cognitive architecture (Intuition, Cognitive Core, Somatic, Social, Governance), its guiding principles, and its strategic place within the Cultivation project.
    *   **Start here** to understand the "what" and "why" of this domain.

*   **[The Drill Cookbook](./drill_cookbook.md)**
    *   **Purpose:** The practical, version-controlled manual of all cognitive training exercises. Provides step-by-step procedures, progression ladders, and success criteria for each drill.
    *   **Use this** as your daily training guide for the "how."

*   **[The 4-Week MVP Pilot Plan](./mentat_os_pilot_plan.md)**
    *   **Purpose:** The actionable project plan for the initial implementation and validation of the Mentat-OS. Details the schedule, measurement framework, and deliverables for the pilot program.
    *   **Refer to this** for the immediate implementation and validation roadmap.

*   **[Cognitive Training Data Schemas](../../2_requirements_and_specifications/data_schemas/cognitive_training_schemas.md)**
    *   **Purpose:** Defines the precise data contracts for all data generated by and for this domain, including raw drill logs and the processed `cognitive_training_weekly.parquet` file.
    *   **This is the technical reference** for the domain's data pipeline.

## 3. How to Use This Section

For a comprehensive understanding of the Cognitive Augmentation Domain, it is recommended to read the core documents in the following order:

1.  **The Blueprint:** To grasp the overall architecture and philosophy.
2.  **The Drill Cookbook:** To see how the architecture is translated into practical exercises.
3.  **The Pilot Plan:** To understand the immediate plan for implementing and testing the system.
4.  **The Data Schemas:** For technical details on how performance is measured and stored.

## 4. Integration with the Holistic Performance Enhancement (HPE) System

This domain is a core component of the "Cultivation" project and integrates deeply with its other systems:

*   **Potential Engine (Î ):** Performance on the drills detailed in the `drill_cookbook.md` will generate a rich set of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). These KPIs will be a primary input for the Cognitive (`C(t)`) component of the global Potential Engine, providing a direct, measurable signal of cognitive skill development.
*   **Synergy Engine:** The introduction of this domain and its associated data streams unlocks the ability to test for powerful new synergies. For example, the system can now analyze the influence of physical training (`Running`, `Strength`) on cognitive KPIs (`WM-Span`, `Logic-Acc`) and vice-versa.
*   **Task Management & Scheduling:** Daily cognitive drills are designed to be scheduled and tracked as tasks within Task Master, integrated into the user's daily plan via the HPE schedulers.

## 5. Current Status

This domain is currently in the **Pilot Planning & Implementation Phase**. The core documents are being created, and the 4-Week MVP Pilot Plan outlines the immediate next steps for baseline testing and initial training.


The **Mentat Cognitive Augmentation Domain** represents a systematic approach to developing hybrid human-AI cognitive capabilities through structured training protocols. This domain focuses on measurable enhancement of core cognitive functions including working memory, logical reasoning, pattern recognition, somatic awareness, and social cognition.

The Mentat-OS framework provides a comprehensive system for cognitive training that integrates seamlessly with the broader Holistic Performance Enhancement (HPE) ecosystem, contributing valuable data to both the Potential Engine (Î ) and Synergy Engine components.
